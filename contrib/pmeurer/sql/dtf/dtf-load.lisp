;; DBL: This code expects that the dtF shared library (or
;;  an alias) is available on the library search path, which
;;  includes the ccl: folder and the system folder's extensions
;;  folder.  dtF/SQL 1.73 includes the appropriate shared library.
;;  If you have MPW (available for free from Apple), you can use
;;  the MPW PPC static libraries from dtF 1.6 by converting them
;;  to a shared library; the converted library and the files used
;;  to do the conversion are in the sql:dtf-library folder.
;;
;;  If you can log in to sLab's web site, you should probably pick
;;  up version 1.73 instead of using the converted 1.6 library.
