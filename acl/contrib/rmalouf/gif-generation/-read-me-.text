Howdy,

I've just cooked up a simple ACL interface to the gd GIF generation
library that some of you might be interested in.  Unlike the CWEST gd
interface, this one will send a GIF to a Lisp stream, which lets a
cl-http server generate images on the fly without creating any
temporary files.  It's not very well tested, so let me know if you
have any trouble with it.  You can get the code from:

Enjoy!
