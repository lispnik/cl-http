<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>

<p> The HTML Parser Generator is a semi-SGML compliant framework for
generating customized HTML parsers. It comes with source code and a couple
of examples that demonstrate its flexibility. Some of the major features
are listed below: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Modular and extensible design maximizes flexibility.
  <li>Explicit representation of the DTD allows a new DTD to be easily
      substituted.
  <li>Includes DTD's for HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2.
  <li>Thread safe, which allows multiple parsers to run simultaneously.
  <li>Can be used independently or in conjunction with CL-HTTP.
  <li>Allows partial and selective parsing of HTML documents for improved
      efficiency.
  <li>Portable across several flavors of LISP in a variety of environments.
</ul>

<p> The parsers generated are string based. If this is inconvenient, a
considerably older, less powerful and <strong>unsupported</strong> stream
based parser is available. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="components">Parser Components</a></h2>

<p>The parser has been divided into three distinct modules. This approach
should simplify the process of modifying and adapting the parser to a new
purpose. A more detailed description of the parser components follows. </p>

<h3><a name="compiler">DTD Compiler</a></h3>

<p> The DTD compiler provides a means for translating a lispified DTD into
a form usable by the parser. The input, in the form of a lispified DTD, is
augmented with additional information that is required for additional fault
tolerance. The output is a set of data structures that contain the
relationships specified in the DTD. As long as these constraints on the
input and output are obeyed, this module may be safely replaced with
another mechanism without interfering with the other components. </p>

<p> The parameter entity definitions in the DTD can be ignored once the DTD
has been compiled. The compilation process directly substitutes the values
of these entities where they are used. Ordinary entity definitions are
simply noted. </p>

<h3><a name="lexer">Lexer</a></h3>

<p>This parser is designed to handle HTML as it commonly appears, rather
than to produce a parser that is fully SGML compliant. Consequently, this
lexer does not implement all the constructs SGML specifies. Extending the
lexer to deal with other SGML constructs (such as marked sections and the
full parsing of declarations) should involve relatively straightforward
extensions to the existing code. </p>

<p> The lexer is based on Dan Connoly's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/SGML/sgml-lex/sgml-lex">
flex specification</a>. Error reporting has been replaced by reasonable
workarounds, and the additional SGML constructs mentioned have been
ignored. Comments too are currently ignored, though all the code for
reporting them is present in the lexer. The lexer and the parser always
preserve spaces. It is up to the system using them to deal with whitespace
appropriately. </p>

<p> The lexer is fully contained in the file <tt>html-reader.lisp</tt>,
except for some references to the tag definitions, and to the constant
<tt>*eof*</tt>. (In MCL <tt>*eof*</tt> is a variable.) The function
<tt>next-html-token</tt> takes an input a parser structure, which contains
the state of a parse process. Encapsulating the state into a structure
allows a program to run multiple instances of the parser simultaneously. A
call to <tt>next-html-token</tt> returns the next token in the remaining
unprocessed HTML. A token may be a string, an entity, a tag open or tag
close marker, or a comment. So long as these constraints are satisfied, the
lexer may be modified in any manner. </p>

<h3><a name="parser">Parser Generator</a></h3>

<p> The parser generator provides a flexible framework for defining a
customized HTML parser. The parser defined is in the form of a DFA. It
consists of a set of contexts and conditions for making context
transitions. The transitions are defined in a highly constrained language
that allows for testing arbitrary conditions. The contexts are where the
actual parsing takes place. They employ a language that can be used to
specify LISP code to execute when various parse events are encountered. The
events of interest are the opening and closing of an HTML tag, and parsing
of PCDATA. Along with arbitrary LISP code, special forms for performing
specific functions are available. </p>

<p>The parser generator is built around two macros. The first,
<tt>define-html-parser</tt>, defines a function that handles the parser's
context transitions. Each context is embodied within a function defined
using the macro <tt>define-html-parser-context</tt>. The context function
should not be called directly, but only through the parser
function. Given below is the relationship between the parser definitions
and the functions they turn into. Further details of the syntax are
discussed under the <a href="#macros">macro descriptions</a>. </p>

<p> The two macros are designed to resemble LISP function definition macros
(such as <tt>defun</tt>). The macros augment the lambda list with some
standard arguments, which will be discussed below.</p>

<p> The primary parser function (defined through
<tt>define-html-parser</tt>) has relatively little functionality. It is
intended to hand control over to some context, or end the parse process if
necessary. The macro's syntax limits the parser function to testing the
return value from the last context, and selecting the next context to
execute. Four paramters are added to the argument list the macro
receives. The exact form of the resulting argument list is presented under
the <a href="#macros">macro descriptions</a>. </p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>input</tt>
  <dd>This is the HTML string input for parsing.
  <dt><tt>:save-fragments</tt>
  <dd>If this keyword argument is set, the part of the input string
      corresponding to each HTML tag parsed is saved. Note that this string
      shares its structure with the original input string, so modifying it
      is not advisable.
  <dt><tt>:html-tag-instance-class</tt>
  <dd>The value of this keyword argument determines the class of the tag
      instances the parser creates. The default value is
      <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>. Any value given to this argument should
      be a subclass of <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>.
  <dt><tt>:unknown-tag-instance-class</tt>
  <dd>As with <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>, this keyword argument determines
      the class of the tag instances created for those tags that are not
      present in the DTD. Again, any value this argument receives be a
      subclass of <tt>unknown-tag-instance</tt>.
</dl>

<p>The input string is parsed entirely within the various parser contexts
used. The syntax provided allows the user to embed arbitrary LISP code in
places where an event might be expected. An event in the course of parsing
HTML is opening a tag, closing a tag, or reading some data. Event
processing can be conditionalized by the name of the tag parsed. All PCDATA
however is passed through the same LISP code. Each context is allowed to
return a single value, which may be used by the parser to select the next
context to execute. The context's function thus is to correctly order the
various HTML tags extracted, for processing by the user defined LISP
code. This process is complicated by the presence of implicit tag opens and
closes, and incorrect HTML.</p>

<p>Each context provides two special forms for handling HTML data that is
automatically bound to some variables. Both the variables and the forms
have a syntax identical to ordinary LISP functions and variables. All of
these are described below.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>parser</tt>
  <dd>This variable is bound to a data structure that describes the
      parse process, including the input string, the stack of open tags,
      and the current state of the input. This data should be treated as
      read only information.
  <dt><tt>it</tt>
  <dd>This variable is bound to the current structure being processed. The
      structure may be explicitly present in the HTML, or its existence may
      be inferred from the input context. It can be either a tag or PCDATA.
  <dt><tt>start</tt>
  <dd>This variable holds the start position of the current token in the
      input string. For an open tag, it tells where the open tag token
      begins. For a close tag, it tells where the close tag token begins.
  <dt><tt>end</tt>
  <dd>This variable stores the end position of the current token in the
      input string. Like <tt>start</tt>, it is relative to the token, and
      not the tag as a whole.
  <dt><tt>(save <i>data</i>)</tt>
  <dd>Calling this special form tells the parser to save the indicated
      <tt><i>data</i></tt>, which can either be PCDATA or a tag. Only the
      first call on a tag is effective. All subsequent
      calls are ignored. Although the structure saved can be something
      other than the last token read, doing so with tags can involve
      playing with the internals of the parser. A far better method for
      saving customized structures is to subclass
      <tt>html-tag-instance</tt> and <tt>uknown-tag-instance</tt>, and
      include in them special purpose slots. Saving involves linking the
      structure to the last surrounding tag that was saved. Saving a tag
      when it is opened enables all the children of the tag to be saved
      under it. On the other hand, saving a tag when it is closed results
      in a situation where any children saved are linked to the parent of
      the tag, altering the structure of the HTML in a possibly undesirable
      manner.
  <dt><tt>(exit-context <i>value</i>)</tt>
  <dd>This special form tells the context to exit as soon as possible,
      returning the value <tt><i>value</i></tt>. Once
      seen, all code that follows it is ignored. Only clean-up operations,
      such as processing the implied opening and closing of tags, are
      performed. The function takes an optional argument that acts as a
      return value from the context.
</dl>

<p>Using such a defined parser is quite straightforward. The function
<tt>initialize-parser</tt> may optionally be called if a DTD other than the
default DTD is to be used. The parser function can then be called
with the input, the other arguments required, and the optional keyword
arguments. Some optional initialization code is executed, then the start
context is called. Its return value is tested to determine the next context
to execute. This cycle continues until either the input is exhausted, or an
end transition is encountered. An unaccounted transition results in an
error. The return value of the parser is the return value of the last
context executed.</p>

<p>When a context is first entered, all the open tags on the parse stack
are tested against the conditionals defined for open tags. A tag is
processed no more than one time in any given context. Once the tags on the
stack have been processed, the next token is taken from the input
string. The context continues to extract tokens so long as the
<tt>exit-context</tt> special form is not encountered, and some input
remains to be processed.</p>

<p>The parser does not enforce or consider the many ordering or repetition
rules that the DTD defines. It only deals with inclusion, exclusion and
containement constraints. So, one might be able to have two bodies within a
single HTML document. Although broken, it allows the parser to recover a
parse of all the parts of the document. This amounts to handing over other
decisions to whatever program is using the parser.</p>

<p>It is somewhat more difficult to produce a reasonable parse of a
document while ignoring containment rules. The following rules describe how
the parser deals with out of context tags: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Search the stack of open HTML tags to find a tag that may contain 
      the out of place tag.
  <li>If there is no such tag on the stack, recursively apply this rule to 
      the tag that is the most likely container of this tag.
  <li>If the tag is an unknown, it can fall under any tag with a non-empty
      content, and can include any tag.
</ol>

<p> For example, if a lone <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> is found immediately inside 
a <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>, the the parser shall check the stack to see if 
there is a tag on the stack that can contain the <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt>. 
Since its immediate container is <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>, no such tag is 
present. The most likely container for an <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> is defined to 
be a <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt>, which is then put on the stack as the container 
of the <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt>. </p>

<p> These are often not the right heuristics to apply while parsing a
page. Instances of input that would break the parser include <tt>&lt;a
...&gt;&lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&lt;/a&gt;</tt>, a relatively common
construct.  The parse result would look like <tt>&lt;a
...&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&gt;</tt>, which is certainly
undesirable. Another place where this breaks is if the document begins 
with an incorrectly defined comment. Such a comment is treated as 
<tt>PCDATA</tt>. Consequently, the start of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> is 
assumed to be at this point. Ignoring ordering and numerical constraints 
allows us to proceed to parse the entire document, and then let the larger 
application decide how to treat the entire document. Though not ideal, this 
solution does leave us with the ability to recover. </p>

<h2><a name="interface">Parser Interface</a></h2>

<p>This section walks through the interface functions and some utilities
that the HTML parser system provides. The description is in terms of the
role each individual piece plays, rather than how they connect to one
another. Please look at the <a href="#components">parser components
overview</a> for the big picture.</p>

<h3><a name="data-structures">Data Structures</a></h3>

<p><strong><tt>html-parser-token</tt></strong> [class]<br>
These are defined based on the tokenizer from
<a href="http://wilson.ai.mit.edu/">CL-HTTP</a>. They are used to name
various objects. <tt>html-parser-token</tt> is an abstract class, of which
no instances are contructed. It's subclasses are <tt>html-name-token</tt>
and <tt>html-entity-token</tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-name-token</tt></strong> [class]<br>
<tt>html-name-token</tt> is the subclass of <tt>html-parser-token</tt> used
for defining names in HTML. These names can be tag names and attribute
names, both of which are case insensitive. They are constructed by
attaching a <tt>#t</tt> in front of the string form of the token name. For
instance, <tt>#t"ul"</tt> corresponds to the name token for UL.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-entity-token</tt></strong> [class]<br>
<tt>html-entity-token</tt> is the subclass of <tt>html-parser-token</tt>
used for representing HTML entities. These tokens are case sensitive, and
are constructed by prefixing a <tt>#e</tt> to the string name of the
entity. For instance, <tt>#e"uuml"</tt> is the name token for the HTML
entity &amp;uuml.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-tag</tt></strong> [class]<br>
The data read from the lispified version of the DTD about HTML tags is
stored in instances of this class. These are likely to be of limited value
when parsing an HTML document.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-attribute</tt></strong> [class]<br>
Instances of this class are used to store information about the attributes
of the various tags. They are also used to index the tag attributes parsed
from an HTML document.</p>

<p><strong><tt>abstract-tag-instance</tt></strong> [class]<br>
This is the class of all the instantiated tags. Its subclasses, rather than
it, should be instantiated. The class has slots for the tag it
instantiates, the HTML parts (tags and PCDATA) within the tag instance, the
tag it is a part of, the attribute values defined for the tag, and the part
of the HTML document this tag represents. The attribute values are stored
as an association list, indexed on the attribute structure in the tag
definition. If the attribute is not defined in the DTD, the
<tt>html-name-token</tt> corresponding to the attribute name is used.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-tag-instance</tt></strong> [class]<br>
This subclass of <tt>abstract-tag-instance</tt>, is for representing
instances of tags defined in the DTD. It, or any of its subclasses, can be
used for this purpose. More information on this can be found in the
<a href="#macro">macro definition</a> for <tt>define-html-parser</tt>. </p>

<p><strong><tt>unknown-tag-instance</tt></strong> [class]<br>
This subclass of <tt>abstract-tag-instance</tt> is used for representing
instances of tags that are not defined in the DTD. It can be substituted
with any other of its subclasses. For more information, please refer to the
<a href="#macro">macro definition</a> for <tt>define-html-parser</tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>parser</tt></strong> [structure]<br>
This is a transient structure for storing information about the particular
parse process. It contains the input string, the current state of the input
string, a stack containing the open tags the parser has seen, etc. This
data should only be modified by the internals of the parser.</p>

<p><strong><tt>tag-parser-data</tt></strong> [structure]<br>
This structure stores transient information about HTML tags as they are
parsed. These structures, rather than tag instances themselves, are stored
on the parser stack mentioned above.</p>
  
<h3><a name="variables">Variables and Constants</a></h3>

<p><strong><tt>*html-dtd-list*</tt></strong> [constant]<br>
This association list translates an HTML <TT>DOCTYPE</TT> to a lispified
DTD filename. It is not currenly used.</p>

<p><strong><tt>*current-dtd*</tt></strong> [variable]<br>
This variable stores the DTD loaded while initializing the parser. If
<tt>nil</tt>, the parser is not initialized.</p>

<p><strong><tt>*html-tags*</tt></strong> [variable]<br>
This is a list of all the tags read from the DTD file.</p>

<p><strong><tt>*html-root*</tt></strong> [variable]<br>
This variable contains the root tag for the DTD. The root tag is the
only tag that does not have a container. It is calculated, rather than
arbitrary set to the HTML tag.</p>

<p><strong><tt>*html-characters*</tt></strong> [variable]<br>
This variable enumerates the HTML character entities defined in the
DTD.</p>

<h3><a name="macros">Macros</a></h3>

<p><strong><tt>define-html-parser</tt></strong> [macro] (name args &rest
forms)<br>
The more elaborated syntax and description of this macro is given
below:</p>

<pre>
define-html-parser <i>parser-name</i> ({<i>arg</i>}* [&key {<i>keyword-arg</i>}*]
                                {<i>other-arg-form</i>}*)
                   [:initialization {<i>form</i>}*]
                   :transitions <i>transition-list</i>
    <i>arg-separator</i> ::= &key | &rest | &aux
    <i>transition-list</i> ::= [[ (:start <i>context</i>) |
                           {(<i>last-context-name</i> <i>transition-test</i> <i>context</i>)}* |
                           {(<i>last-context-name</i> <i>transition-test</i> :end)}* ]]
    <i>transition-test</i> ::= t | <i>symbol</i> | <i>string</i> | <i>html-name-token</i> | <i>function</i> |
                        (:eval {<i>form</i>}*)
</pre>

<p>This macro expands into a function named <tt><i>parser-name</i></tt>
that executes some initialization code, followed by a series of context
transitions. The optional initialization code is executed as an implicit
<tt>progn</tt>. The lambda list of the generated function takes as input a
combination of some pre-defined parameters and those provided in
<tt><i>lambda-list</i></tt>. The generated function has a lambda list of
the form</p>

<pre>
(<i>input-string</i> {<i>arg</i>}* &key :save-fragments :html-tag-instance-class
                          :unknown-tag-instance-class {<i>keyword-arg</i>}*
                     {<i>other-arg-form</i>}*)
</pre>

<p>The macro expansion, in other words, adds some arguments to the lambda
list given to the macro. These arguments have the following roles:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt><i>input-string</i></tt>
  <dd>This is the HTML string input for parsing.
  <dt><tt>:save-fragments</tt>
  <dd>If this keyword argument is set, the part of the input string
      corresponding to each HTML tag parsed is saved. Note that this string
      shares its structure with the original input string, so modifying it
      is not advisable.
  <dt><tt>:html-tag-instance-class</tt>
  <dd> The value of this keyword argument determines the class of the tag
      instances the parser creates. The default value is
      <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>. Any value given to this argument should
      be a subclass of <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>.
  <dt><tt>:unknown-tag-instance-class</tt>
  <dd>As with <tt>html-tag-instance</tt>, this keyword argument determines
      the class of the tag instances created for those tags that are not
      present in the DTD. Again, any value this argument receives be a
      subclass of <tt>unknown-tag-instance</tt>.
</dl>

<p>The transitions list defines the desired context transitions. The first
context executed is the one headed by <tt>:start</tt>. Each
<tt><i>context</i></tt> is a function call to a parser context that returns
a two values - the name of the context and a second arbitrary
value. <tt><i>context</i></tt> may be replaced by <tt>:end</tt>, in which
case the parse process is terminated. An ordinary context transition is
headed by the name of the last context executed, and a test on the return
value of the context. The test is interpreted as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>t</tt>
  <dd>The transition is made without performing any tests.
  <dt><tt><i>symbol</i> | <i>string</i> | <i>html-name-token</i></tt>
  <dd>If not already an <tt>html-name-token</tt>, the test object is
      translated to one. This value is then compared using <tt>eq</tt> with
      the generic function <tt>name</tt> applied to the return value of the
      last context. (<tt>name</tt> tries to coerce its input to an
      <tt>html-name-token</tt>.) The format for specifying an
      <tt>html-name-token</tt> is <tt>#t"<i>tag-name</i>"</tt>, where
      <tt><i>tag-name</i></tt> is a case insensitive name for the tag. For
      instance, <tt>#t"img"</tt> is the token for the HTML tag img.
  <dt><tt><i>function</i></tt>
  <dd>The return value of the last context is passed as an argument to the
      specified function. The transition is made if the function does not
      return <tt>nil</tt>.
  <dt>(:eval {<i>form*</i>})
  <dd>{<i>form*</i>} is evaluated as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>. The return
      value is compared via <tt>eq</tt> to the result of calling the
      generic function <tt>name</tt> on the return value of the last
      context.
</dl>

<p>Parsing terminates automatically when the input string is exhausted.</p>

<p><strong><tt>define-html-parser-context</tt></strong> [macro] (name
arguments &rest forms)<br>
The full syntax and description of the macro is given below.</p>

<pre>
define-html-parser-context <i>name</i> ({<i>arg</i>}* [&aux {<i>aux-arg</i>}*])
                           [:use-variables {<i>use-variable</i>}*]
                           [:on-open-tag {<i>tag-conditional-form</i>}*]
                           [:on-close-tag {<i>tag-conditional-form</i>}*]
                           [:on-pcdata {<i>form</i>}*]
    <i>tag-conditional-form</i> ::= (<i>tag-condition</i> {<i>form</i>}*)
    <i>tag-condition</i> ::= :any | <i>tag-name</i> | ({<i>tag-name</i>}*)
    <i>tag-name</i> ::= <i>symbol</i> | <i>string</i> | <i>html-name-token</i>
</pre>

<p>This macro defines a function for an HTML parser context. The function
named <tt><i>name</i></tt> has the following lambda list:</p>

<pre>
(parser {<i>arg</i>}* &aux {<i>aux-arg</i>}* {<i>use-variable</i>}* <i>exitp</i> <i>exit-var</i>)
</pre>

<p>The <tt>{<i>form</i>}*</tt> found in
<tt><i>tag-conditional-form</i></tt> constitute an implicit <tt>progn</tt>
composed of arbitrary LISP expressions. They can include references to the
following special forms and variables:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>parser</tt>
  <dd>This variable is bound to a data structure that describes the
      parse process, including the input string, the stack of open tags,
      and the current state of the input. This data should be treated as
      read only information.
  <dt><tt>it</tt>
  <dd>This variable is bound to the current structure being processed. The
      structure may be explicitly present in the HTML, or its existence may
      be inferred from the input context. It can be either a tag or PCDATA.
  <dt><tt>start</tt>
  <dd>This variable holds the start position of the current token in the
      input string. For an open tag, it tells where the open tag token
      begins. For a close tag, it tells where the close tag token begins.
  <dt><tt>end</tt>
  <dd>This variable stores the end position of the current token in the
      input string. Like <tt>start</tt>, it is relative to the token, and
      not the tag as a whole.
  <dt><tt>(save <i>data</i>)</tt>
  <dd>Calling this special form tells the parser to save the indicated
      <tt><i>data</i></tt>, which can either be PCDATA or a tag. Only the
      first call on a tag is effective. All subsequent
      calls are ignored. Although the structure saved can be something
      other than the last token read, doing so with tags can involve
      playing with the internals of the parser. A far better method for
      saving customized structures is to subclass
      <tt>html-tag-instance</tt> and <tt>uknown-tag-instance</tt>, and
      include in them special purpose slots. Saving involves linking the
      structure to the last surrounding tag that was saved. Saving a tag
      when it is opened enables all the children of the tag to be saved
      under it. On the other hand, saving a tag when it is closed results
      in a situation where any children saved are linked to the parent of
      the tag, altering the structure of the HTML in a possibly undesirable
      manner.
  <dt><tt>(exit-context <i>value</i>)</tt>
  <dd>This special form tells the context to exit as soon as possible,
      returning the value <tt><i>value</i></tt>. Once
      seen, all code that follows it is ignored. Only clean-up operations,
      such as processing the implied opening and closing of tags, are
      performed. The function takes an optional argument that acts as a
      return value from the context.
</dl>

<p>Each <tt><i>tag-conditional-form</i></tt> that matches the current tag
is executed. Matching is limited to testing the name of the tag. The name
can be specified as a symbol, a string or an <tt>html-name-token</tt>. A
list of tags can be specified in place of a single tag. Alternatively, the
keyword <tt>:any</tt> can be used to define some code to execute for any
tag encountered.</p>

<h3><a name="functions">Functions</a></h3>

<p><strong><tt>initialize-parser</tt></strong> [function] (&optional doctype)<br>
This function loads and initializes a DTD for use with the parser. The
default DTD is that for HTML 3.2. The only other option currently available
is loading the one for HTML 2.0. This function <strong>must</strong> be
called before a parser is invoked.</p>

<p><strong><tt>file->string</tt></strong> [function] (path)<br>
Returns the contents of the file indicated by <tt><i>path</i></tt> as a
string.</p>

<p><strong><tt>stream->string</tt></strong> [function] (stream)<br>
Returns the contents of <tt><i>stream</i></tt> as a string.</p>

<p><strong><tt>name</tt></strong> [function] (object)<br>
Returns the name of the <tt>html-tag</tt> indicated by
<tt><i>object</i></tt>, or <tt>nil</tt> if the object cannot correspoond to
an <tt>html-tag</tt>. </p>

<p><strong><tt>parts</tt></strong> [function] (tag-instance)<br>
Returns the parts of <tt><i>tag-instance</i></tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>part-of</tt></strong> [function] (tag-instance)<br>
Returns the tag that <tt><i>tag-instance</i></tt> is a part of.</p>

<p><strong><tt>html-fragment</tt></strong> [function] (tag-instance)<br>
Returns the string fragment corresponding to
<tt><i>tag-instance</i></tt> in the input string.</p>

<p><strong><tt>attr-values</tt></strong> [function] (tag-instance)<br>
Returns all the attribute-value pairs for the given
<tt><i>tag-instance</i></tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>attr-val</tt></strong> [function] (attribute tag-data &optional default-value error-if-not-found)<br>
Tries to look for a value corresponding to <tt><i>attribute</i></tt> in
<tt><i>tag-data</i></tt>. <tt><i>attribute</i></tt> can be specified as a
<tt>string</tt>, <tt>symbol</tt> or an <tt>html-name-token</tt>. If not
found, <tt><i>default-value</i></tt> is returned, unless
<tt><i>error-if-not-found</i></tt> is set. Otherwise an error is
signalled.</p>

<p><strong><tt>parser-input</tt></strong> [function] (parser)<br>
Returns the input string for a particular instance of
<tt><i>parser</i></tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>parser-stack</tt></strong> [function] (parser)<br>
Returns the parser stack for a particular instance of
<tt><i>parser</i></tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>make-pcdata-string</i></tt></strong> [function] (parts &optional collect-alt-p)<br>
Constructs a string out of the PCDATA contained in the
<tt><i>parts</i></tt> given to the function. If
<tt><i>collect-alt-p</i></tt> is set, each tag encountered is tested for an
<tt>ALT</tt> attribute. If found, the value of the attribute is collected,
otherwise the PCDATA contained within the tag is used. </p>

<p><strong><tt>html-whitespace-p</tt></strong> [function] (char)<br>
Tests if the <tt><i>char</i></tt> is whitespace by HTML standards.</p>

<p><strong><tt>tokenize-name</tt></strong> [function] (string)<br>
Constructs an instance of <tt>html-name-token</tt> from
<tt><i>string</i></tt>. </p>

<p><strong><tt>tokenize-entity</tt></strong> [function] (string) <br>
Constructs an instance of <tt>html-entity-token</tt> from
<tt><i>string</i></tt>.</p>

<p><strong><tt>ensure-html-parser-tokens</tt></strong> [function] (tree &key ignore-if (destructive t))<br>
Attempts to translate all items found in <tt><i>tree</i></tt> to an
<tt>html-name-token</tt>. All items that satisfy the predicate
<tt>ignore-if</tt> are skipped. If <tt>destructive</tt> is set, the tree is
modified destructively. Otherwise, parts of the tree that can be safely
reused shall not be duplicated while constructing a result tree.</p>

<h2><a name="examples">Examples</a></h2>

<h3><a name="simple-parser">Simple Parser</a></h3>

<p>As the name suggests, this parser does very little. It parses the HTML
document, and returns the parsed structure. The code for the parser is in
<tt>HTML-PARSER:html-utilities.lisp</tt>. The parser has one context that
runs until the input is exhausted, or an HTML close tag token is
encountered.</p>

<p>The syntax for calling the parser is</p>

<pre>
(simple-parser <i>html-document</i>
               &key :save-fragments :html-tag-instance-class
                                    :unknown-tag-instance-class)
</pre>

<p>where <tt><i>html-document</i></tt> is the HTML document stored in a
string. The keyword arguments play the same role as in the description of
the macro <a href="#macros"><tt>define-html-parser</tt></a>. </p>

<h3><a name="handler">Parser with Handler Call-back</a></h3>

<p>This is a more extended example demonstrating some of the additional
flexibility that may be gained by defining a parser as a series of
transitions in a DFA. The code for the parser is contained in
<tt>HTML-PARSER:examples;handler.lisp</tt>, and needs to be loaded as an
optional package.</p>

<p> The main parser function is <tt>parse-with-handler</tt>. It should be
called in a context defined by the macro <tt>with-tag-handler</tt>. This
macro establishes a call back condition. If on parsing some HTML tag the
conditions defined by the macro are satisfied, the specified handler is
called. These contexts may be nested to form a hierarchy. Without a
context, the parser shall parse the document but never process any of the
data generated from the parse. </p>

<p>
<tt>with-tag-handler</tt> has the following lambda list:
</p>

<pre>
	(with-tag-handler (&lt;tags&gt; &lt;handler-function&gt; &amp;key &lt;with-attributes&gt;
			   &lt;without-attributes&gt; &lt;test&gt;)
	  &lt;body&gt;)
</pre>

<p> <tt>tags</tt> is the list of tags for which a context should be
established. This may be a symbol, list of symbols or strings, or the value
<tt>t</tt> which stands for all tags. The symbols or strings should be
names of tags for which to establish contexts, or <tt>PCDATA</tt>, or
<tt>UNKNOWN</tt>. <tt>handler-function</tt> is the call-back function for
the context. <tt>with-attributes</tt> is a list of attributes that must be
present in the open tag markup, and <tt>without-attributes</tt> is a list
of tags that should not be present in the open tag markup. <tt>test</tt> is
an arbitrary lisp predicate that determines if the desired context is
present. A context is said to be present only if the conjuction of all the
above conditions holds. <tt>body</tt> is executed within the established
handler. It may be any lisp form, including other <tt>with-tag-handler</tt>
specifications (which provides a mechanism for specifying multiple
handlers), and one or more calls to <tt>parse-html</tt>. </p>

<p>
<tt>parse-html</tt> has the lambda list
</p>

<pre>
	(parse-html input &amp;key tags save-fragments html-tag-instance-class
                               unknown-tag-instance-class)
</pre>

<p> <tt>tags</tt> is the list of tags which have to be present in the
resulting parse structure. It too can be a list of symbols or strings,
including <tt>PCDATA</tt> and <tt>UNKNOWN</tt>. (I had considered including
the specification for <tt>tags</tt> in <tt>with-tag-handler</tt>, but could
not guage how valuable this would be.) <tt>save-instance-fragments</tt>,
<tt>html-tag-instance-class</tt> and <tt>unknown-tag-instance-class</tt>
have their usual function.</p>

<p>The function <tt>html-parse-result</tt> is a simple example of how the
handler call-back mechanism is supposed to be used. It takes an input path
as a string or a pathname, and invokes the parser on the specified
file. The return value is a parse of the HTML document rooted in an
instance of the <tt>HTML</tt> tag.</p>

<h3><a name="link-collector">Parser for Collecting Links</a></h3>

<p>This example demonstrates how the parser may be linked in with the World
Wide Web Walker (w4) in the CL-HTTP system. It takes one of the examples in
the CL-HTTP package, <tt>show-web-link-map</tt>, and redefines it to use
the parser to collect all links in the document. For this example to work,
it is necessary to first load the CL-HTTP system, then the HTML Parser
Generator. Then, the W4-WEB-WALKER and the W4-WEB-WALKER-DEMOS need to be
loaded. Finally, the parser definition and additional functions the example
needs are in the file <tt>HTML-PARSER:examples;parser-show-link-map</tt>.
</p>

<p>When this is done, the example should work as before, collecting links
from not only the <tt>a</tt> tag, but also from the <tt>img</tt> and
<tt>link</tt> tags. Access the page <tt>/cl-http/w4.html</tt> relative to
the CL-HTTP server, and follow the link to the show-web-link-map
example. Use the form to generate the trace for all nodes starting from a
WWW page.</p>
