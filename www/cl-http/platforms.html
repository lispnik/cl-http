<ul> 

<p><li><b>MCL 4.x (3.x 68k):</b> CL-HTTP runs in multi-threaded mode under MCL
4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 the PowerPC native version of MCL, its companion 3.1, 3.2,
3.3, 3.4 for 68K machines.The MCL CL-HTTP server is considered <a
href="/cl-http/release.html"><b>released </b></a> software when running under
current versions of Macintosh Common Lisp. Contact <a
href="http://www.digitool.com">Digitool, Inc.</a> for information on how to
upgrade to MCL 4.3. The comparable version for 68K Macs is MCL 3.4.

</p>

<p><li><b>MCL 3.9:</b> CL-HTTP runs in multi-threaded mode under MCL 3.9, the
PowerPC native version of MCL.</p>

<p><li><b>MCL 3.0:</b> CL-HTTP also runs in multi-threaded mode under MCL 3.0.
The MCL CL-HTTP server is considered beta test software when running Macintosh
Common Lisp 3.0. </p>

<p<li><b>MCL 2.0.1</b> Although the server does run in single-threaded mode
under MCL 2.0.1, MCL CL-HTTP is unsupported and considered <b>alpha test</b>
in versions prior to MCL 3.0.</p>

<p><li> <b>Bug Reports:</b> If you encounter bugs, unclear documentation, or
other shortcomings, please report them to <b><a
href="mailto:bug-mcl-cl-http@ai.mit.edu">bug-mcl-cl-http@ai.mit.edu</A></b>
with a description of how to reproduce the problem and the version of CL-HTTP
you were using.  Ideally, use the distributed sources to fix the problem and
send us the fix along with the report.</p>

<h2><a name="lispm"><img src="/cl-http/icons/check-yes.gif"> Symbolics Lisp Machines</a></h2>

<ul> <p><li><b>Genera 8.3:</b> CL-HTTP was originally developed on Symbolics
Lisp Machines and the most sophisticated versions continue to run on Ivory and
36xx machines under Genera 8.3.</p>

<p><li><b>Open Genera:</b> CL-HTTP has been compiled and run under Open Genera
8.4 running on the DEC Alpha. It is currently being tested under Open Genera
8.5 interim.</p>
