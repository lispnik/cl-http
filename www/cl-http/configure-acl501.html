<h1>Configuring Allegro CL 5.0.1 cl-http</h1>

<p>Before building cl-http be sure to check the list of patches in the <a
href="/cl-http/sources/acl501/-read-me-.text">acl501 read me</a> file and install them if
necessary.</p>

<p>There are three principle ways of using <strong>cl-http</strong> within <strong>acl</strong>:

<ol>
  <li>As a developer of <strong>cl-http</strong> who may be modifying <strong>cl-http</strong>
    soure code as well as his own code</li>
  <li>Loading <strong>cl-http</strong> into an existing application.</li>
  <li>Using <strong>cl-http </strong>as a standalone web server.</li>
</ol>

<p>We'll describe ways of building <strong>cl-http</strong> that is best for each case
above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. cl-http developer</h2>

<p>The simplest way to get <strong>cl-http</strong> up and running is to start lisp,
change to the <strong>acl501</strong> directory of the cl-http source and load start.lisp</p>

<pre>user(1): <strong>:cd /import/cl-http-70-16-rel/acl501</strong>
user(2): <strong>:ld start</strong></pre>

<p>This will compile (if necessary) and load in the compiled version of the <strong>cl-http</strong>
source, then start the server on port <strong>8000</strong> and then load in the sample <strong>cl-http</strong>
pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting the server may fail for a few reasons: 

<ol>
  <li>The port <strong>8000</strong> is already in use by another process</li>
  <li>The <strong>dns</strong> name of the machine can't be determined.&nbsp;&nbsp; This port
    of <strong>cl-http</strong> tries to automatically determine the <strong>dns</strong> name
    of the machine on which it's running.&nbsp; This is usually successful but it can fail if
    the <strong>dns</strong> libraries on the machine are written in a certain way.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<p>If the server fails to start the error message will tell you what caused it to fail.
&nbsp; You'll have to start the server manually using the <strong>http:start</strong>
function.&nbsp; See the steps below for how that it done.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may want to
create your own version of the <strong>start.lisp</strong> file that passes the necessary
arguments to <strong>http:start</strong> so that it will startup on your machine.</p>

<p>Another way to load and start <strong>cl-http</strong> is to:</p>

<pre>user(1): <strong>:cd /import/cl-http-70-16-rel/acl501</strong>
user(2): <strong>:ld load
</strong>user(3):<strong> (build-cl-http)
</strong>user(4):<strong> (http:start)
</strong>user(5):<strong> (load-test)</strong></pre>

<p>This is very similar to what <strong>start.lisp </strong>does.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <strong>http:start</strong> function takes a number of keyword arguments, the most
important being:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="14%">:port</td>
    <td width="86%">The port on which the server should listen for connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; On
    Unix a process must be run as <strong>root</strong> to listen to ports less than 1024.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The default value for this parameter is 80.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="14%">:host</td>
    <td width="86%">The <strong>dns</strong> name of this host.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally it's
    best to not specify this value and let <strong>cl-http</strong> figure it out, however if
    it can't then you must supply the value</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>(load-test)</strong> step above loads in the sample <strong>cl-http </strong>pages
that describe <strong>cl-http</strong> itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; These pages can only be loaded
after the server has been started.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. Using cl-http in an application</h2>

<p>If you want to add <strong>cl-http</strong> to an existing application then it's best
to compile all of the <strong>cl-http</strong> files into one large file: <strong>cl-http.fasl</strong>.
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is done by</p>

<pre>user(1): <strong>:cd /import/cl-http-70-16-rel/acl501</strong>
user(2): <strong>:ld load
</strong>user(3):<strong> (build-cl-http :create-fasl t)</strong></pre>

<p>The last step creates <strong>cl-http.fasl</strong> that you can then load into your
application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. Using <strong>cl-http </strong>as a standalone application</h2>

<p>We've included in <strong>load.lisp</strong> an example of how to create a standalone <strong>cl-http</strong>
application.&nbsp;&nbsp; This example is meant as a template.&nbsp; Our sample server
doesn't serve anything.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The first step in creating the standalone application is creating <strong>cl-http.fasl</strong>
as described in step <strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>We'll assume that you haven't done
that and show that in the steps below:</p>

<pre>user(1): <strong>:cd /import/cl-http-70-16-rel/acl501</strong>
user(2): <strong>:ld load
</strong>user(3):<strong> (build-cl-http :create-fasl t)
</strong>user(4):<strong> (makeapp)</strong></pre>

<p>The <strong>makeapp</strong> function is defined in <strong>load.lisp</strong> and
you'll want to study this function and alter it to create your own standalone application.
&nbsp; The result of the <strong>makeapp</strong> function will be a set of files in the <strong>acl501/cl-http-app
</strong>directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These files contain an executable and support files
that when run will start up a <strong>cl-http</strong> server.&nbsp; </p>
