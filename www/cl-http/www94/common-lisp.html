Draft ANSI specification</A>) to provide a user-extensible environment for
interactive multimedia over WWW.  Because the goal is to develop a
fine-grained vocabulary of operators that programs and software developers
share, Common LISP is one of the best choices available today.  Once operators
are abstracted, programs and users call them, instead of (re-)writing them
again.  This fine-grained abstraction yields high productivity because:

<li><B> No Code Duplication:</B> No effort is wasted writing again code that
already exists because programs are shared at a very fine level of abstraction
(<I>e.g.</I>, individual functions, variables).

<P>
<li> <B>Code Evolution:</B> Well abstracted code is easily evolved as
protocols or requirements change.

<P><LI><B>Dynamic Linking</B>: Incremental compilation speeds development of
large programs and facilitates evolutionary programming.

<P> <li> <B>Powerful Abstractions:</B> Function-compositional languages, such
as Common LISP, allow, and even encourage, programmers to build up a
vocabulary of high-level operators that are recycled to solve similar domain
problems.  Indeed, writing an application becomes a process of developing a
vocabulary of operators to specify the desired functional
process.<footnote>[See <A HREF="references.html#Abelson-Sussman-1985"> Abelson
and Sussman (1985)</A> for a detailed introduction to abstraction in a
functional language.]</footnote>

	A high productivity environment reduces the work required to develop
new packages and makes most efficient use of the scarce time of scientists.
Generalizing the individual case to a community of researchers, sharing this
kind of environment and each other's extensions maximizes the rate at which
the community searches mechanism space for problem solutions.  Moreover,
well-abstracted code joins with self-documenting capabilities in the HTTP
server to make it an effective pedagogical environment; everything is readily
available for inspection, modification, and experimentation.

<h2><A name=CLOS>The Common LISP Object System</A></h2>

<P>Common LISP embeds a native object-oriented programming language, the
Common LISP Object System (CLOS).  All significant datastructures in the HTTP
server are implemented as CLOS objects (<A
href="references.html#Bobrow-1988">Bobrow <I>et al.</I>, 1988</A>; <A
HREF="references.html#Keene-1989">Keene, 1989</A>).  CLOS distinguishes
classes and instance objects. The behavior of instance objects is defined by
associated classes, which can inherit functionality and state variables from
multiple superior classes.  Instances can have local state, held by instance
variables, and they can have methods, or operations, which they support.
Generic operations constitute a protocol that instances of different classes
all support with their own, possibly different methods.  CLOS supports
<I>multimethods</I> that can dispatch based on the types of multiple
arguments. A pervasive object-oriented implementation helps enforce
abstraction and modularity as it enhances flexibility and code sharing.

<p><h2>The Common LISP Interface Manager</h2>

<p>Modern Common LISP provides a high-level window system tool, the Common
LISP Interface Manager (CLIM) (see <A name=CLIM
HREF="FTP://cambridge.apple.com/pub/clim/papers/clim.ps">the
specification</A>, (<A HREF="references.html#Rao-York-Doughty-1991">Rao, <I>et
al</I>, 1991</A>).  Written in Common LISP, CLIM runs on a variety of
workstations, implementing its machine-independent abstractions with native
window systems and mimicking their look and feel.</footnote> By introducing
high-level abstractions for specifying window interfaces, CLIM makes it easier
and quicker to define window interfaces.  Instead of requiring many months,
sophisticated user interfaces can be written in several days.

<P>Beyond general window system abstractions, the automatic form processing in
<A HREF="server.html#COMLINK">COMLINK</A> forms relies heavily on an important
CLIM abstraction: <I>the presentation system</I> controls how the user
specifies or perceives arbitrary LISP objects. Each <I>presentation type</I>
has a method to <I>present</I> (display) an object on the computer screen, and
a method to <I>accept</I> (receive input) an object from the user, whether via
the keyboard, the mouse, or other input device.

<P>In general, presentation types specialize built-in or constructed LISP
types.  <I>Presentation translators</I> can be defined to convert from the
LISP object associated with one presentation type to another.  The combination
of type subsumption and presentation translation allows CLIM to resolve
equivalences, and thus, accept input more intelligently.

<P> The present and accept methods are like little generators and parsers
specialized to a presentation type.  They can perform a simple operation, such
as accepting an integer between 1 and 10, or they can execute a very complex
computation.  For example, in one research system (<A
HREF="references.html#mallery-1991">Mallery, 1991</A>), nodes in semantic
network representing natural language text can be presented through a sentence
generator so that the user sees them as generated sentences or sentence
fragments.  Similarly, sentences or paragraphs can be accepted via a
presentation type that calls a full natural language system to parse and
represent the text.  Thus, present and accept methods execute LISP code that
can perform an arbitrary translation between what the user sees or what the
user inputs and the internal datastructures manipulated by programs.

<P>Once defined, these presentation types mediate all data entry and display,
and thus, users perceive only the external, user-friendly representation, and
never with the internal representation. Yet, such dynamic, bidirectional
translation allows users to <I>directly</I> manipulate program data (viewing
it in translated form) and actually simplifies the program model presented to
the user.
