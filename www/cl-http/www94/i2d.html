<title>Learning If-Then Rules with I2D</title>

<h1>Learning If-Then Rules with I2D</h1>

<P> A system for learning if-then rules from a dataset is available in the
Feature Vector Editor. Perhaps the most successful AI algorithms are a family
of entropy-based techniques for inducing decisions trees. <I>Decision
trees</I> organize tests hierarchically such that running the tests along a
path from the top to any leaf classifies an example within a category. Because
they rely on global information measures, these techniques require a
one-to-one mapping between values of compared variables that is found only in
flat datamodels (one feature vector).  Complex datamodels -- for example the
hierarchically-structured feature vectors in the SHERFACS International
Conflict Management Dataset -- almost always give rise to one-to-many mappings
between values of compared variables, but this violates the fundamental
assumption of conventional decision-tree learners, rendering them unusable for
all but the most limited analyses of SHERFACS.  Unseld and Mallery (<A
href="references.html#Unseld-Mallery-1991">1991</A>) found a unifying solution
to this problem that generalizes earlier techniques along several dimensions
in order to handle complex datamodels.  The key insight is to decompose
examples into local observations until one-to-one comparisons again become
possible, and then, to recombine these local comparisons to ultimately arrive
at global information measures.  Their <I>Induction Interaction Detector</I>
(I2D) implements an inductive rule learner suitable for studying complex
datasets like SHERFACS because it supports learning on the tree-structured
temporally related feature-vector data.

<P> Significant features include:

<UL>

<P><LI> <B>Time-Dependent Analysis:</B> Support for temporally structured data
makes it possible to learn decision trees and rules to predict outcomes on the
basis of prior variable values;

<P><LI> <B>Regularity Recognition:</B> Instead of narrowly focusing on
classification, I2D is designed to identify regularities between dependent and
independent variables;

<P><LI> <B>Exploratory Data Analysis:</B> Because it can identify regularities
in data and is not limited by degrees of freedom, I2D is an excellent tool for
exploratory data analysis, sifting through new or little-understood data to
find the significant relationships that statistical methods might later test.

<br> Considerable work went into handling various kinds of variables that
appear in SHERFACS, including variables that range over multiple values within
examples, variables whose number of values varies dynamically, and variables
whose values are sets or sequences. See Mallery (<A
href="references.html#mallery-1994">1994</A>) for an overview and references
to this work.
