<title> Natural Language Question Answering</title>

<h1> Start Natural Language System</h1>
<P>
The START natural language system (SynTactic Analysis using Reversible
Transformations) consists of two modules which share the same Grammar.  The
understanding module analyzes English text and produces a knowledge base which
incorporates information found in the text.  Given an appropriate segment of
the knowledge base, the generating module produces English sentences.  A user
can retrieve the information stored in the knowledge base by querying it in
English.  The system will then produce an English response. (See <A

In addition, by annotating free-form text with English phrases and sentences,
then matching these annotations with incoming queries,the power of
sentence-level natural language processing can be effectively put to use in
the service of information retrieval.  Furthermore, this technique generalizes
easily to the indexing and retrieval of all types of information, whether or
not these are based on text. (See <A HREF="references.html#Katz-1994">Katz, 1994</A>)

The START natural language system was demonstrated at the conclusion of
Voyager's Grand Tour of the outer planets, as the spacecraft sent back images
of Neptune and discovered new moons and rings around the planet.  During the
encounter, researchers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and members of the
press in the JPL press room were able to use the START system to retrieve
information concerning the encounter, the Voyager spacecraft, and the solar
system.
