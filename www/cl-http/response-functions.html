<p>Writing Common Lisp functions that compute responses to incoming HTTP
requests is the main feature of the CL-HTTP.  This page documents the
supported interfaces that allow you to do this.  In conjunction with the <a
href="/cl-http/find-documentation?HTML:">HTML Synthesis tools</a>, these
facilities allow you to dynamically compute web pages.</p>

<p>Response functions compute a reply to the HTTP methods GET or POST.  Before
returning HTML to the client, they must arrange for an appropriate status code
and appropriate headers to be returned, usually via the macro <a
href="#with-successful-response">http:with-successful-response</a>. A response
function becomes accessible only after an associated URL is exported with <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:EXPORT-URL">http:export-url</a>.  A
number of working examples of response functions are available in <a
href="/cl-http/sources/examples/exports.lisp">
http:examples;exports.lisp</a>.</p>

<ol>

<h2><li><a name="url-classes">Classes of Computed URLs</a></h2>

<p>Four general classes of URLs that compute responses to requests.

<dl>

<p><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left">
<b>HTTP-COMPUTED-URL</b> merely returns some HTML in response to the HTTP GET
method. It receives no arguments from the client.The HTML is computed by a
response function which takes two arguments: the requested URL and the STREAM
to the client.</p>

<p><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left"> <b>HTTP-FORM</b>
computes the response to the HTTP POST method.  It performs any side effects
and returns HTML to the client based on submitted values.  The response
function receives three arguments: the requested URL, the STREAM to the
client, and a QUERY-ALIST of values.  The macro <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:BIND-QUERY-VALUES">http:bind-query-values</a>
is normally used to decode and bind the contents of the QUERY-ALIST as local
variables within the response function.<p>

<p><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left">
<b>HTTP-COMPUTED-FORM</b> is just like HTTP-FORM except that it also computes
the response to the HTTP GET method by synthesizing the HTML fillout form
which the client may later POST back to the server. The form function receives
two arguments: the requested URL and the STREAM to the client.  In order to
synthesis the form for the client, the form function needs to use <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:ACCEPT-INPUT">html:accept-input</a> to
emit HTML input types (user queries] within the scope of the macro <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:WITH-FILLOUT-FORM">html:with-fillout-form</a>.
</p>

<p><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left"> <b>HTTP-SEARCH</b>
computes a response to the HTTP GET method based on arguments passed in via
the search suffix of the URL following the "?".  The response function
typically uses arguments from the search suffix accessed by <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?SEARCH-KEYS">url:search-keys</a> to compute
a returned HTML page and perform any side effects. It may also refer to search
database with <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?URL:SEARCH-DATABASE">url:search-database</a>.
At times, the response function may wish to access the parent of the search
URL with <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?URL:SEARCH-PARENT">url:search-parent</a>,
for example to issue a new search anchor.  The arguments to a search URL can
carry only a relatively small amount of data compared to POSTing to a form
because the URL standard limits URLs to 1024 characters.</p>

</dl>

<h2><li><a name="http-interfaces">Server Interfaces</a></h2>

<p>When CL-HTTP receives an HTTP request, it creates an instance of the class
SERVER from which all information relevant to the transaction can be accessed.
This section documents the program interfaces to the server object.  Among
other things, these interfaces allow response functions to:</p>

<p><ul>

<li> Return status codes and headers to the client;

<li> Access HTTP headers sent by the client;

</ul></p>

<dl>

<h3><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left">Variables</h3>

<ul>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:*SERVER*">HTTP:*SERVER*</a>:</b> A
variable that is always bound to the server instance handling the current
transaction.</p>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:*SERVER-CLASS*">HTTP:*SERVER-CLASS*</a>:</b>
Advanced applications may set this variable to a specialization of standard
server class in order to customize the behavior of CL-HTTP.</p>

</ul>

<h3><dt><img src="/cl-http/icons/pinkball.gif" align="left">Functions and Macros</h3>

<ul>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:ALLOW-USER-ACCESS-P">HTTP:ALLOW-USER-ACCESS-P</a>:</b>
Use this function to decide which real resource will be accessed based on the
identity of the user accessing a controlled resource.  For example, people in
the developers group see more internal details than regular users.</a>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:BIND-QUERY-VALUES">HTTP:BIND-QUERY-VALUES</a>:</b>
Use this macro with a the response function to a POST method in order to bind
the incoming values of a form to local variables.  The local variables will be
the same name as the query identifiers used on the input types in the actual
form.</p>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:CURRENT-USER-AGENT">HTTP:CURRENT-USER-AGENT</a>:</b>
Provides a convenient interface to identifying the client accessing the
resource. This useful,for example, in conjunction with <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:USER-AGENT-CAPABILITY-P">http:user-agent-capability-p</a>
for deciding in your response function whether to use the <a
href="/cl-http/find-documentation?NS1.1:-TABLE">Netscape table
extensions</a>.

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:DEBUG-SERVER">HTTP:DEBUG-SERVER</a>:</b>
Allows errors during HTTP transactions to enter the debugger by turning
off most condition handling.  Challenging bugs in response functions
succumb most easily when debugging from the runtime environment of an
interactive LISP debugger.

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:GET-HEADER">HTTP:GET-HEADER</a>:</b>
Provides marginally faster access to the value of header in the current http
transaction.

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?URL:EXPIRATION-UNIVERSAL-TIME">URL:EXPIRATION-UNIVERSAL-TIME</a>:</b> returns
the universal time when a URL should expire. It should be used to compute the expires argument for the macros <a
href="#with-successful-response">http:with-successful-response</a> and <a
href="#with-conditional-get-response">http:with-conditional-get-response</a>.

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:REDIRECT-REQUEST">HTTP:REDIRECT-REQUEST</a>:</b>
Use this function to issue a redirect to another URL.</a>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:SEND-MAIL-FROM">HTTP:SEND-MAIL-FROM</a>:</b>
Use this function to send email from a response function. Normally, you will
want to specify the from field as <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:*SERVER-MAIL-ADDRESS*">http:*server-mail-address*</a>.
Lisps other than Symbolics Genera, need to initialize smtp:*network-mail-host*
and enumerate any secondary mailer in smtp:*store-and-forward-mail-hosts*. For
automatic bug reporting, see <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:REPORT-BUG">http:report-bug</a>.</p>

<p><li><b><a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-SERVER-INTERFACE-ENVIRONMENT">HTTP:WITH-SERVER-INTERFACE-ENVIRONMENT:</a></b>
Binds a series of variables useful for writing response functions.  It
actually creates symbol-macros that macroexpand at compile time into the
correct form to obtain the desired information. Dynamic values are shown in
the example of the <a href="/cl-http/server-interface-environment.html">Server
Interface</a>.  The CL-HTTP Server Interface 1.0 is largely analogous to <a
href="/cl-http/cgi-environment.html">CGI 1.1</a> (available via <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-CGI-ENVIRONMENT">http:with-cgi-environment</a>),
except it produces values that are more useful to the Lisp programmer and it
renames some variables for better mnemonics.  Additionally, one may use the
methods on the server objects for more advanced applications, including ones
in which the SERVER class itself is specialized (See <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:*SERVER-CLASS*">HTTP:*SERVER-CLASS*</a>).</p>

<p><li><b><a name="with-server-push-response"
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?NS1.1:WITH-SERVER-PUSH-RESPONSE">NS1.1:WITH-SERVER-PUSH-RESPONSE</a>:</b>
This macro allows a response function to keep the open the connection
and replace displayed URIs for clients supporting Netscape 1.1
extensions. It use a multipart MIME body that is sent in blocks.  The
macro takes care of sending the appropriate status code and relevant
headers back to the client, and thus, does not require use of <a
href="#with-successful-response">html:with-successful-response</a> or
variants.</p>

<p><li><b><a name="with-successful-response"
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-SUCCESSFUL-RESPONSE">HTTP:WITH-SUCCESSFUL-RESPONSE</a>:</b>
This macro should wrap around all code in a response function.  It takes care
of sending the appropriate status code and relevant headers back to the
client.</p>

<p><li><b><a name="with-conditional-get-response"
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-CONDITIONAL-GET-RESPONSE">HTTP:WITH-CONDITIONAL-GET-RESPONSE</a>:</b>
When the computation can return the same result as the one cached by a client
or a proxy server, wrap this macro around all code in a response function
instead of <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-SUCCESSFUL-RESPONSE">http:with-successful-response</a>.
The generic function <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:url:expiration-universal-time">url:expiration-universal-time</a>
is used to compute the value for the expires argument.</p>

</ul>
</dl>

<h2><li><a name="presentation">Advanced Input Management</a></h2>

The server comes with a facility that simplifies the presenting and
accepting user data which is called the <a
href="/cl-http/w3p/w3p.html">W3P Presentation System</a>. This facility
relieves the programmer from calling <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:ACCEPT-INPUT">http:accept-input</a>
directly and (re-)writing validation code for each element of form data
received. Instead the programmer invokes generic operations on
presentation types that automatically make the correct calls to <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:ACCEPT-INPUT">http:accept-input</a>
and automatically process the returned values. The presentation types
form a lattice of types describing all the data types either presented
to or received from the user. Applications can easily extend the
presentation system by defining new types, presenters, and parsers. It
is <em>strongly recommended</em> that you learn to use W3P because it
will help you reduce code duplication and speed the development of
interactive Web applications as it simplifies and streamlines your
response functions.

<h2><li><a name="considerations">Issues in Response Functions</a></h2>

<ol>

<p><li><b>Collisions Across Threads:</b> Because CL-HTTP is
multi-threaded, it can respond to multiple client requests
simultaneously.  This makes it important to ensure that response
functions to not collide while accessing a shared resource.  Reading the
same data is fine.  But, writing the same data can cause unpredictable
results and trouble. If you need to write shared data from a response
function, you must to arrange to synchronize the accesses to shared
resources by the different HTTP connections using process tools
available in your Common Lisp.</p>

<p><li><b>Efficiency:</b> Response functions need to be as efficient as
possible in order to service your users swiftly and maximize the load that
your server can carry, given its endowment in processor speed and physical
memory.

See the <a
href="/cl-http/efficiency.html">Efficiency Heuristics</a></b> for ideas on how
to keep your code nimble.</p> 

<p><li><b>Conformant HTML:</b> Normally, the macros <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:WITH-HTML-DOCUMENT">html:with-html-document</a>,
<a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:WITH-DOCUMENT-PREAMBLE">html:with-document-preamble</a>,
and <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:WITH-DOCUMENT-BODY">html:with-document-body</a>
should be used to establish the status of the resource returned to the client and
to delineate the components of the resource. Clients, especially SGML aware
ones, and servers are increasingly reliant on this information.

<p><li><b>Evolution:</b> Because the HTML standards are evolving, you may wish
to always use the HTML synthesis tools to emit HTML.  This way, each time the
standards change (every 4-6 months), you merely use the next version of the
synthesis tools, rather than revising all your code. Defining higher level
abstractions above the CL-HTTP synthesis tools can allow you to slot in new
features to implement those abstractions as new and more powerful versions of
of HTML become available.</p>

<p><li><b>Standing Search URLs:</b> Often it is desirable to have both search
url and fillout form interfaces to a computed response by the same function..
The fillout form can provide a more user-friendly environment while the search
url can be inserted in documents to run a prespecified operation with one
click. This idea is applied by <a
href="/cl-http/find-url?find-documentation?">/cl-http/find-documentation?</a>
and <a
href="/cl-http/find-documentation.html">/cl-http/find-documentation.html</a>
whose implementation is available in <a
href="/cl-http/sources/examples/documentation.lisp">http:examples;documentation.lisp</a>.</p>

<p><li><b>Carrying State Across HTTP Transactions:</b> Sometimes it is desirable to
associate state with uses of resources. Examples of most of the techniques below are
available in <a
href="/cl-http/sources/examples/exports.lisp">http:examples;exports.lisp</a>.</p>

<ul>

<p><li><b>Hidden Fields:</b> <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:ACCEPT-INPUT">html:accept-input</a>
supports the input type <em>hidden</em>, which carries state with the form
without displaying it on the client side.  Just like normal input types, the
macro <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:BIND-QUERY-VALUES">http:bind-query-values</a>
can rebind the hidden value when the form is returned.   When using <it>hidden
fields</it>, <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WRITE-TO-ARMOR-PLATED-STRING">
http:write-to-armor-plated-string</a> and <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:READ-FROM-ARMOR-PLATED-STRING">
http:read-from-armor-plated-string</a> protect Lisp data from damage by HTML
and HTTP escaping in transit.</p>

<p><li><b><a href="/cl-http/cookies.html">Client-Side Cookies</a>:</b> Some
browsers support <a
href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">client-side
cookies</a> to store state across HTTP transactions and sessions. To set
cookie values, the primitive function <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:MAKE-SET-COOKIE-HEADER-VALUE">
http:make-set-cookie-header-value</a> creates values for the SET-COOKIE.  The
top-level macro <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:SET-COOKIE-HTTP-HEADERS">
http:set-cookie-http-headers</a> expands into possibly multiple calls to <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:MAKE-SET-COOKIE-HEADER-VALUE">
http:make-set-cookie-header-value</a>, ensures that the client handles
cookies, and returns a header plist that can be passed in as the additional
headers argument to <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-SUCCESSFUL-RESPONSE">
http:with-successful-response</a>, or relatives. To inspect cookie values, <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-COOKIE-VALUES">http:with-cookie-values</a>
allows provides an interface for accesses cookies transmitted by the
client.</p>

<p><li><b>HTML Meta Info:</b> Outside forms, <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTML:DECLARE-META-INFO">html:declare-meta-info</a>
allows header information to be passed back to a client hidden in the HTML
markup.</p>

<p><li> <b>Maintaining the Connection:</b> <a
href="#with-server-push-response">Server push</a> allows the server to
maintain dynamic state because it keeps client connection open.  Beyond these
approaches, maintenance of state on the server side requires a backing store,
for example a transaction-controlled, persistent-object database.</p>

</ul>

<p><li><b>Displaying Pages in Specific Browser Window:</b> The content of URLs can be
displayed in named windows on a number of clients.  TARGET arguments to HTML generation
forms provide on way to do this.  It is also possible to send the :window-target header
with a string naming the window in which to display.  This header can be sent as an
additional header for <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-SUCCESSFUL-RESPONSE">http:with-successful-response</a>
and related response macros. The function <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?NS2.0:CLIENT-TARGET-WINDOW-HTTP-HEADERS">
ns2.0:client-target-window-http-headers</a> constructs the header to send only when the
client supports the feature.
