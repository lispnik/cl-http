<h2>
<a NAME="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
This page describes a set of development projects that you could contribute
to the CL-HTTP community. You will work with an international team of CL-HTTP
developers, and perhaps learn some interesting things about advanced Common
Lisp programming as you win recognition and build your reputation in the
Lisp community.
<p><b>Please be a good citizen and contribute something, no matter how
small, to improve these tools for yourself and other users.</b> Not only
did somebody else write this server, client, web walker, proxy, full-text
search engine,
<br>mail hyperarchive, and numerous extensions, they also empowered you
with the source code. Why not invest a little effort in return? In the
end, you will help yourself by showing that the Lisp culture can produce
shared resources and motivating the major developer to continue providing
high-quality advanced software to you without charge.
<p>Before contributing code, you may wish to consult the <a href="/cl-http/guidelines.html">guidelines</a>
and <a href="/cl-http/efficiency.html">efficiency considerations</a>.
<p>If you are working on some code for CL-HTTP, please send a paragraph
(or a URL) to <a href="mailto:www-cl@ai.mit.edu">www-cl@ai.mit.edu</a>
(or <a href="mailto:bug-cl-http@ai.mit.edu">bug-cl-http@ai.mit.edu</a>
if you would prefer less notice) explaining what you are doing, your time
frame, and how to contact you. That way, people will know what you are
doing and can contact you if they have ideas, suggestions, or want to help
out. It can also help avoid duplicated effort. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html#archives">WWW-CL
archives</a> to see what other people are doing.

<h2>
<a NAME="ideas"></a>Project Ideas</h2>

<ol type=A>
<h3>
<a NAME="enhancements"></a><b><li>Server Enhancements</b></h3>

<ol>

<b><li>Protocol Conformance</b> 

<ul>
<b><li>HTTP 1.1 Proxying:&nbsp;</b> Complete remaining details of HTTP proxying.
Maximize efficiency and flexibility. Support on all platforms.

<b><li>HTTP 1.1 Digest Authentication: </b>Update the current digest implementation
to conform with the latest draft of the digest specification (proposed
standard digests).

<b><li>File Upload: </b>Complete and polish implementation of file upload standard,
making sure that it works on all platforms. Obtain code from John Mallery.

<b><li>New Cookies: </b>Implement the new cookie extension specification for
HTTP.

<b><li>HTTP Features: </b>Implement the HTTP feature extension that allows
clients and servers to advertise the set of features that they support
in a standardized way.

<b><li>Content Negotiation:</b> Implement the HTTP 1.1 content negotiation
specification. (see: <a href="/cl-http/standards/rfc2068.text">RFC 2068</a>)

<b><li>Multiple Languages &amp; Character Sets</b>

<b><li>HTTP 1.1 Details: </b>Make sure all advanced and obscure features of
HTTP 1.1 are implemented.
</ul>

<b><li>HTML 4.0 Generation: </b>Implement HTML 4.0 as an extension of current
generation tools.

<b><li>XML Generation &amp; Parsing:</b>&nbsp; Provide efficient tools for
generating and parsing XML. This should include RDF and some RDF schemas
as a high priority.

<li>
<a NAME="style-sheets" href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/"></a><a NAME="style-sheets" href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/"></a><a NAME="style-sheets" href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/"></a><b><a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/" name="style-sheets">Cascading
Style Sheets</a>:</b> Implement style sheet generation tools (CSS2) for
integration with HTML 3.2 generation facilities.

<b><li>CLIM Server Window: </b>Overhaul the existing CLIM window so that:

<ul>
<li>
It runs on multiple platforms

<li>
It offers a full set of relevant commands

<li>
It edits user access control information

<li>
It offers a variety of useful displays, including:

<ul>
<li>
Realtime log display

<li>
Performance statistics

<li>
Metering of URL access times
</ul>
</ul>

<b><li>Efficiency Enhancements</b>

<ul>
<b><li>Header Buffers: </b>Parse HTTP headers into resourced header buffers.
Resource header objects. Raw header strings become offsets into the header
buffer.

<b><li>Resource URLs: </b>Uninterned URL are created with increasing frequency
by search URLs, proxying, and other applications, these should be resourced
to minimize consing.

<b><li>Data Caching Facility:</b>

<ul>
<li>
Develop caching policies for the pathname datacaching facility.

<li>
Develop directory-oriented caching policy that is invoked via a keyword
on directory export.

<li>
Where applicable,&nbsp; provide areas to hold cache data structures and
GC policies for optimal performance.

<li>
Integrate the caching proxy with the datacache facility.
</ul>

<b><li>Server Metering: </b>Use Henrik Frystyk's (<a href="mailto:frystyk@w3.org">frystyk@w3.org</a>)
TCP metering tools and test suite to improve server latency, throughput
and efficiency.

<b><li>Double-Buffered Asynchronous Transfer: </b>Develop platform-specific
facilities, where applicable, for multi-buffered asynchronous TCP transfers.
This improves performance by queuing new buffers TCP to ship, and thus,
freeing Lisp to continue computing rather than blocking waiting for TCP
to complete delivery of the current buffer.
</ul>

<b><li>Implementation Enhancements</b>

<ul>
<li>
Declarative Header Parsing/Generation

<li>
Declarative URL Parsing/Generation

<li>
Escape Characters In Exported Pathnames

<li>
Fill CLOS Caches On Start-Up Or Save of Binary Images

<li>
Factor Into Component Modules

<ul>
<li>
Client

<li>
HTML Synthesis
</ul>
</ul>

<b><li>Compressed Page Transfer Encoding</b>

<ul>
<li>
Provide GZIP compression of static files in a manner analogous to CRLF encoding.

<li>
Implement Deflate Compression and Uncompression

<li>
Integrate with Server &amp; Client

<li>
Support

<ul>
<li>
Compressed Static Pages

<li>
On-the-fly Compression

<li>
On-the-fly Uncompression
</ul>
</ul>

<b><li>Portable Dynamic Form Processing: </b>Use the W3P presentation system
to replace CLIM in the Dynamic Forms module. Make Dynamic Forms run portably.
The Dynamic Form processing facility is a high-level object-oriented form
processing facility that predates HTML form and allows very high level
coding of forms with maximal code reuse. It has been used in COMLINK for
5 years and currently drives all the forms used over SMTP and HTTP on the
White House Publications system.

<b><li>Secure HTTP:</b> Implement HTTP tunneling using after-download cryptography.&nbsp;
The first step involves implementing a digest authenticated tunnel that
allows the client to know&nbsp; with complete certainty that the server
received the HTTP message in tact and processed the request successfully.

<b><li>Proxy Service:</b> Add intelligent caching to proxy implementation (see
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html">CERN server</a>).
This is pretty important for many companies that operate through firewalls.
It is also very handy for downloading URLs to a powerbook for <a href="/cl-http/configure.html#local-talk">disconnected
use</a>

<b><li>Custom Logging: </b>Develop a variety of custom log formats that yield
useful information about HTTP operations. Useful ideas include logging:

<ul>
<li>
Form submissions and responses

<li>
Metering information for URLs

<li>
Proxy operation

<li>
Precomputed server analyses
</ul>

<b><li>Portable Remote CLOS Interface:</b> Develop an object interface using
<a href="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">Inter-Language
Unification</a> (ILU) from <a href="http://www.xerox.com">Xerox</a>'s <a href="http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com">Palo
Alto Research Center</a>. Develop interfaces to readily available persistent
object stores and <a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/sunrise/DistComp/Objects/corba.html">CORBA</a>.

<b><li>Performance Tools</b>

<ul>
<b><li>Logfile Replayer (aka Web Monkey): </b>Given an HTTP logfile, re-execute
the requests against a selected server. This is an indispensable tool for
serious performance tuning of CL-HTTP ports.

<b><li>Metering: </b>Develop higher level metering facilities atop the current
facilities that capture computation expended on a per URL basis.

<b><li>HTML Display of Performance Statistics: </b>Write HTML displays to facilitate
use of metering information to enhance URL performance.

<b><li>Tracing Tools</b>

<ul>
<b><li>Show Execution Process</b>
</ul>
</ul>

<b><li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): </b>Integrate SSL support into the Web server
and client using foreign function calls into the freely available reference
implementation in C. The <a href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/SSL.html">C
code and specification</a> distributed by Netscape allows non-commercial
use for free and commerical use for a license fee. A more ambitious effort
would rewrite the C code in Lisp tuned for speed. See also <a href="http://www.apache.org/related_projects.html">Apache-SSL</a>

<b><li>Digital Signatures:</b>

<ul>
<li>
Develop a framework for digitally signing static and dynamic resources.

<li>
Ensure portability DSS signature code (available from John Mallery).

<li>
Devise key management&nbsp; system.

<li>
Document secure operation of digital signature facility.
</ul>

<b><li>Site Management Tools: </b>Develop a change management facility and
incorporate it into tools for managing the content of Web site. Contact
Rainer Joswig for existing code and further suggestions.

<b><li>Portable Lisp Substrate: </b>Develop an integrate substrate from the
various port sources that allows CL-HTTP to run across platforms with minimal
platform-specific code. Special attention needs to be paid to creating
common frameworks for:

<ul>
<li>
Networking

<li>
Processes

<li>
Locking

<li>
Streams
</ul>

<b><li>Cruise the source code</b> and look for bugs, incomplete features, better
numerical declarations, inefficiencies and write patches to fix them.
</ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="documentation"></a><b><li> Server Documentation Projects</b></h3>

<ol>

<b><li> <a NAME="tutorial"></a>Develop a CL-HTTP Tutorial Using <a
href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~plb/In<terBook.html&quot;">Interbook</a></b>.
Contact Peter Brusilovsky <a
href="mailto:plb@cs.cmu.edu">plb@cs.cmu.edu</a> for further
information.

<b><li>Extend the online <a href="/cl-http/cl-http.html">manual</a> or <a href="/cl-http/sources/examples/exports.lisp">tutorial</a></b>
by writing one or more sections that explains how to do something. The
manual should be written in HTML and should explain things with live working
examples. We need to target these audiences:

<ul>
<b><li>Naive users</b> who just want to serve web pages with minimal fuss.

<b><li>Novices who want to Learn Lisp</b>

<b><li>Lisp-capable people</b> who want to write their own response functions
and hook up their own systems but do not want to learn more about CL-HTTP
than it takes to solve their problem.

<b><li>Lisp Programmers who want to Learn the Server</b>

<ul>
<b><li>Extend and annotate the example file <a href="/cl-http/sources/examples/exports.lisp">exports.lisp</a>.</b>
Improve the comments to make this example more of a live tutorial. Add
additional examples illustrating any previously undocumented features.

<b><li>Improve documentation strings and comments in source code:</b> Give
priorities to those areas people are most likely to use or find confusing.
</ul>

<b><li>Wizards</b> who want to understand the details of CL-HTTP and the Web
so they can experiment with new extensions to CL-HTTP and the Web. There
may be a category of wizards who are not lisp hackers and we should have
a way to reach them.
</ul>

<b><li>Overview Server &amp; Architecture</b>

<b><li>Interfacing Existing Applications</b>

<ul>
<li>
CLIM To Web

<li>
GGIs To LISP
</ul>

<b><li>Create icons and gifs</b> for use spicing up CL-HTTP generated pages
and advertising the technology.

<b><li>Dynamic FAQ: </b>Implement a facility for capturing, storing, searching,
and displaying FAQs. The facility should provide ultra-targeted answers
to user queries based on an inventory of questions and answers,

<b><li> Graphical Class Hierarchy Browser:</b> Implement a Web-based interface
for browsing CLOS class hierarchy and viewing associated documentation
strings.  Use this to document CL-HTTP class structure. The interface should
utilize Lisp's introspection capabilities, using basic (widely supported)
Meta-Object Protocol calls to generate and update the tree structure.  Pick a
few standard starting points, such as the url class.  Tree layout algorithms
could be combined with the GIF generation code or Java to provide a nice
graphical front-end.

<h3>
<a NAME="Log-Analysis"></a><li>Log Analysis</h3>

<ol>
<b><li>Efficient Storage Format: </b>Develop a storage format that requires
no parsing or analysis when loading log files into memory. The format should
be modular so that only logfiles in a time interval need to be examined.

Living in a Dynamic TCP/IP Environment</a>'' which describes how to
write OpenTransport code that correctly handles multiple IP addresses,
dial-up links, sleep and wakeup on PowerBooks, modem disconnection, and
user reconfiguration.

<b><li>Binary Application with User Interface:</b> Develop a stand-alone
binary app so people without MCL can run the server. This involves
developing a GUI user interface from which the user can operate and
maintain the server.  Among other things, it means an interface to
specifying the configuration file and ensuring that it is loaded on
start up. Have a look at the <a
href="http://www.uwtc.washington.edu/Computing/WWW/Remote.html">remote
administration interface</a> for MacHTTP. Alternatively, a forms-based
approach would be portable across multiple platforms and would be safe
once secure http is incorporated.
