<h1><img src="/cl-http/icons/construction.gif" align="left"> Heuristics for Efficiently Computing HTTP Responses</h1>

<p><img src="/cl-http/icons/line-rain.gif"></p>

<p> The efficiency of your Common Lisp Web application depends on how
you write the functions that compute responses to HTTP requests.
CL-HTTP has been designed to run efficiently even as it preserves
abstractions that enhance intelligibility and extensibility.  But, this
cannot compensate for how you compute responses or generate HTML on the
fly. Below are a series of heuristics that will help you write Lisp code
that runs fast without sacrificing the power and flexibility of
LISP.</p>

<p>In general, there is a trade off between program abstraction,
efficiency, and portability across hardware platforms as well as LISP
releases. For this reason, one must always weigh whether a small
increment in performance today is worth the price of undoing it later
when you want to run the code under different circumstances. Always
prefer abstraction and portability, unless efficiency needs are
paramount and optimizations are true.</p>

<p>These heuristics are arranged in descending order of importance.</p>

<b>
<ol>

<p><li> Come up with efficient algorithms (logarithmic or better) in
the first place.</p>

<p><li> Minimize unnecessary consing by using destructive operators
and copying datastructures only when necessary.</p>

<p><li> Meter your code because this is the only way to really find
out where it is spending its time.  (See the Common Lisp TIME
function)</p>

<p><li> Understand what your program is actually computing based on your
reading of the LISP manual.</p>

<p><li> Avoid serializing threads responding to requests because of a
shared resource.</p>

<p><li> Avoid unnecessary disk accesses because moving parts are slow,
which means get lots of physical memory and turn off virtual memory
where possible.</p>

<p><li> Turn on the ephemeral garbage collector so that short-lived
garbage is reclaimed before being swapped out to disk.</p>

<p><li> Use the LOOP iteration macro and especially the iteration
paths like COLLECT, APPEND, NCONC because these expand into very
efficient code. </p>

<p><li> Declare all numeric operations to death so that you don't wind
up doing bignum arithmetic all the time (not necessary on a Lisp
Machine).</p>

<p><li> Don't use FORMAT because it incurs to much overhead parsing the
control string.</p>

<p><li> Use resources to recycle datastructures rather than consing new ones,
unless the allocation/deallocation overhead is more expensive than merely
creating new structures each time.</p>

<p><li> Minimize calls to generic functions in the critical path,
except where method specialization enhances abstraction.</p>

<p><li> Maybe prefer WITH-SLOTS and SLOT-VALUE over slot accessors which
are generic functions and use fast slot accessors when available.
Beware that in some implementations, the situation is reversed and
generic function accessors wind up faster than WITH-SLOTS or
SLOT-VALUE.</p>

<p><li> Reduce the number of function calls by inlining small abstractions in
the inner most loop, but avoid bloating the working set.  In general, one
needs metering tools to determine when this is appropriate because it is
usually not intuitive.  </p>

<p><li> Prefer iteration over recursion, except when a computation is
inherently recursive, because it reduces the number of function
calls.</p>

<p><li> Use the DYNAMIC-EXTENT declaration on local variables bound by
a LET to inform the compiler that temporary datastructures can be
deallocated on exit from the scope of the LET (stack consing).</p>

<p><li> Prefer FLETed local functions to anonymous LAMBDAs which can
refer to lexical variables yet allow the closure to be consed on the
stack rather than the heap.

<p> <li> Map functions over sequences or lists rather than creating a
new list. Either explicitly pass in all arguments to the LAMBDA or make
it an FLETed named function with DYNAMIC-EXTENT declared.</p>

<p><li> Inline local functions like those defined by FLET in order to
eliminate excess function calls while capturing a local cliche.</p>

<p><li> Pass in positional arguments to sequence operations when
available in the local context rather than forcing their recomputation
as default values are assigned.

<p><li> Minimize use of keyword arguments in frequently called functions (but
not macros or inline functions) in order to avoid the runtime overhead of
processing the keyword arguments.</p>

<p><li> Keep the numbers of arguments passed to inner loop functions
down in order to reduce overhead of pushing them onto the stack. Many
Common Lisps handle the first four arguments very efficiently.</p>
