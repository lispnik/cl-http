<p> This server was originally written in about ten days during February, 1994
on a Lisp Machine, and incrementally extended thereafter.  In March 1994, it
was incorporated into a larger system under development by the <a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/home-page.html">Intelligent
Information Infrastructure Project</a> at the AI lab. That larger system,
called COMLINK, is an experimental prototype used to <a
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Publications/html/Publications.html">electronically
publish documents</a> released by the <a
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> on a daily basis. In October
1994, the LispM CL-HTTP was fielded as a component of the White House WWW
site. In December 1994, both COMLINK and CL-HTTP were used by the project in
an <a href="http://www4.ai.mit.edu/npr/user/root.html">experimental
collaboration system</a> which supported <a name=www95
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/open-meeting/abstract.html">the
Vice President's Open Meeting</a> on the <a
href="http://www.npr.gov/">National Performance Review</a>.  In March 1996,
the server was used in a hierarchical-adaptive survey of users of White House
Publications that ran over both email and the Web.</p>

<p>Starting in late December 1994, a Macintosh port was developed and publicly
released in June 1995 when the multi-threaded Macintosh Common Lisp 3.0. Soon
thereafter, the server was ported to UNIX running under Allegro Common Lisp
and LispWorks.  A port to Lucid Common Lisp followed in Spring 1996. During
Fall 1996, Windows versions became available. In late Summer 1996, CL-HTTP
became the first HTTP 1.1 compliant server and was used for tested by the
World Web Web Consortium and other member of the IETF HTTP Working group as
they developed reference clients and servers.</p>

<p>One hope in porting CL-HTTP to other platforms is to make it easy for the
Lisp Community to show off their abilities on the World Wide Web. Since its
introduction, some <a /cl-http/acknowledgments.html">enthusiastic
developers</a> helped improve the server and a variety of people have created
<a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html#applications">interesting
applications</a>. From this standpoint, CL-HTTP has successfully empowered
Lisp programmers with tools they needed for a networked information age.</p>
