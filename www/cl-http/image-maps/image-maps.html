<b>The IMAGE-MAP export-type</b> exists to allow well abstracted use of
clickable image formats currently supported on CERN and NCSA servers.  An
image-map is both an image and a searchable object.  Using a configuration
file called a map file, areas of an image are specified to point to different
URLS, either on the local host or at a remote site.  When the client returns
the coordinates of a user's mouse click, the server compares that data to the
information supplied in the map file.  The server then returns either the
contents of a local URL or a redirect to a URL on a remote host.  CL-HTTP
parses the map file into a data structure at export time, so the information
is already in memory when a user responds to an image-map.  To allow
compatability with existing files and graphics tools, either the CERN or the
NCSA format for map files can be specified.

<p>

Image-maps are usually made up of basic shapes (eg. toolbars) but can contain
concave polygons and layered shapes.  They are often used as directories or
indexes, providing a clear, graphical way to organize a group of links.  While
CL-HTTP supports GIF, JPEG, X-BITMAP, PICT, and TIFF searchable image types,
only GIF is supported by most browsers.  While some browsers will inline JPEG
files, many launch an external application and cannot use the file for
image-map purposes.
