<abstract><p><b>Abstract:</b> A Web walker for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) implements a constraint posting control architecture. The Web walker
uses a declarative and extensible vocabulary of <i>constraints</i> to
characterize traversals of Web structures.  Starting from a root resource, the
walker recursively follows all hyperlinks whose associated resource satisfies
the constraints guiding the walk.  Constraints are sorted according to
efficiency class before application to candidate resources. This constraint
ordering conserves computational and network resources.    As the walker
traverses the structure it performs operations that are specified in a
declarative and extensible <i>action</i> vocabulary.  Taken together, a set of
constraints and a set of actions comprise an <i>activity</i>, which can be
named and reused.</p>

<p>Several Web-accessible applications use this constraint-guided framework:

<ul>

<p><li><b>Web Mapper:</b> Hyperlinks from a root uniform resource indicator (URI)
are followed and displayed in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>

<p><li><b>Web Document Locator:</b> A Salton-style statistical retrieval
algorithm is applied to TEXT or HTML documents, which are reported to the user
when their score exceeds a threshold.</p>

<p><li><b>Web Archiver:</b> Regions of Web structure are traversed and
transferred to a local disk drive. Hyperlinks within the structure are
remapped to preserve link structure in the new location.</p>

<h2><li><A name="introduction">Introduction</A></h2>

<p>As the World Wide Web has grown, Web walkers have settled into two general
applications: site maintenance and high-volume indexing.  In these roles, the
walkers have been tuned for specific activities that are applied uniformly
over Web regions. This paper introduces a new constraint-posting architecture
for Web walkers that yields greater flexibility as it decouples control of Web
traversals from actions applied to Web regions. The goal is to facilitate
reuse and sharing of both control and action abstractions, and thus, to open
the way for a new generation of reconfigurable Web walkers that allow people
or intelligent agents to ``power browse'' the Web.</p>

<p>The W4 Constraint-Guided Web Walker is a second generation Web walker
intended for traversing well-specified regions of the World Wide Web and
performing any variety of actions. Control of the walk is specified with an
extensible vocabulary of constraints that limit enumeration of Web resources.
Actions applied to each accepted resource are specified by an extensible
action vocabulary.  Conditional branching in constraints and actions makes
possible adaptive responses to Web topology. Most importantly,
<i>constraint</i> and <i>action</i> abstractions enforce a separation of
control from action as they encourage reuse of control and action
abstractions. The W4 Web walker employs an architecture isomorphic to one
originally developed for a graph walking system for knowledge representation
in the RELATUS Natural Language System (Mallery, 1991). W4 builds on a basic
HTTP client that is distributed with the Common Lisp Hypermedia Server
(Mallery, 1994). W4 extends the abstractions of this server and basic client
to accessing Web resources and walking Web structures.</p>

<h2><li>Control</h2>

<p>


The W4 Web walker is an interpreter for graph structures comprised by
resources accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Berners-Lee, <i>et
alia,</i> 1996).  A web traversal corresponds to the application of an
activity to a root uniform resource indicator (URI) (Berners-Lee, 1994;
Berners-Lee <i>et alia</i>, 1994).  As hyperlinks are extracted from resources
with relevant content types -- such as documents using the Hypertext Markup
Language (Berners-Lee, <i>et alia</i>, 1995) -- a filtering process prunes out
all candidates that do not satisfy formulae in the constraint language.
<i>Actions</i> are then performed on successful candidates.  All the
information required to guide a particular traversal and perform actions is
stored in a named <i>activity</i> object.</p>

<ol type="A">

<h3><li> Interpreter</h3>

<p>An activity executes the following loop at each step in the traversal of a
structure:

<p><ol>

<p><b><li> Enumerate URIs:</b> The body of an HTTP resource is scanned for
URIs and these are returned.</p>

<p><b><li> Apply Constraints:</b> Constraints are applied to filter enumerated
URIs and produce candidate URIs for actions.</p>

<p><b><li> Order Candidates:</b> URIs satisfying the constraints are inserted
into a task queue, possibly prioritize according to an application-defined
predicate.</p>

<p><b><li> Perform Actions:</b> Actions receive the opportunity to apply
themselves to each URI in the task queue.</p>

</ol></p></p>

<h3><li> Computational Complexity</h3>

<P>Walking a Web structure is a graph walk in Web space.  A Web walk is
isomorphic to a tree descent, where starting from an initial node, inferiors
are recursively enumerated (steps 1 and 2), and possibly visited (step 4).
Although tree descent algorithms are exponential in form, here constraints may
bound the absolute number of URIs enumerated and visited.  Thus, the
computational work required to complete a walk is given by the guiding
constraint formula and the actual topology of the region traversed.  In
practice, network factors like HTTP response latency and transfer rates will
contribute significant constant factors to the time required to execute an
activity at each visited node.</p>

<p>A good set of constraints narrows the scope of the Web walk to the URI's of
interest and produces a more tractable walk than might otherwise be achieved
using conventional Web walkers.  Thus, the goal of constraint-guided Web
walking is to devise a constraint formula that generates the smallest, but
compete, set of candidate URIs, and so, performs its activity using the
minimum computational and network resources.</p>

<p>As discussed below, declarative constraints can be ordered for application
in ways that also conserve computational and network resources as each ply
selects candidate URIs

<h3><li> Constraint Types</h3>

<p>Constraints are instances of <i>constraint types</i>. Constraint types
serve as templates governing the behavior of constraint instances.  They hold
general-purpose functionality governing their instances while their instances
store specializing parameters.</p>

<p>There are two general classes of constraint types:

<p><ul>

<p><li><b>Ordinary Constraint Types</b> are the standard class of constraint
type.  They accept arguments but none of their arguments can be other
constraints.</p>

<p><li><b>Circumstance Constraint Types</b> are special constraints that
operate on collections of constraints, and thus, they accept arguments which
are constraint structures. Among other things, these constraint types
implement logical operations and conditional branching over constraint
structures.</p>

</ul></p>

<h4><li> Constraint Instances</h4>

<p>Constraint instances are specialized into subclasses according to
computational efficiency. A sort based on efficiency subclass serves as a
first-pass for ordering constraints.  The ordering is intended both to prune
candidate URIs as fast as possible and to do so with minimum computation and
network access. The current set of efficiency classes for constraints appear
below in decreasing order of efficiency.

<p><ul>

<p><li><b>Context Constraints</b> select a URI based on state information in
the Web walker without the need to first generate URI candidates. No network
access is required. The current depth of the walk is an example.</p>

<p><li><b>URI Constraints</b> involve comparisons between components of URIs
or predicates on their identity. These require generating URI candidates but
they do not involve further network access. In particular, they do not require
lookups in the Domain Name System. Constraints on the subdirectory of URIs are
examples.</p>

<p><li><b>DNS Constraints</b> require lookups in the Domain Name System for
their resolution. Constraints that limit the URIs explored to specific hosts
are examples because canonical host names are required to make reliable host
comparisons.</p>

<p><li><b>Header Constraints</b> require application of the HTTP HEAD method
to the resource for their resolution. Constraints on the content type of a
resource are examples.</p>

<p><li><b>Resource Constraints</b> require the application of HTTP GET method
to obtain the content of the resource. Searching the body of a document for a
substring is an example.</p>

</ul></p>

<h4><li> Ordering and Applying Constraints</h4>

<p><i>Constraint sets</i> bundle collections of constraints. Operations on
constraints are typically done via operations on constraint sets.  Before a
set of candidate URIs can be filtered by the constraints of a constraint set,
those constraints need to be ordered for computational efficiency.  Constraint
sets filter URIs as follows:

<p><ul>

<p><b><li> Order Constraints:</b> Sort all first level constraints in the
constraint set so that the most efficient constraints will be applied first.
Ordinary constraints provide an efficiency sort key directly. Circumstance
constraints recursively examine the constraints they contain to compute an
efficiency sort key, which is the most expensive constraint they scope.</p>

<p><b><li> Apply Constraints:</b> Once constraints are ordered from most
efficient to least efficient, they can be applied to filter enumerated URIs.
By the time more costly constraints are reached, more efficient ones have
reduced the number of URIs remaining under consideration.</p>

</ul></p>

<p>Constraint sets are ordered only once; thereafter they can be applied to
enumerated URIs without further reordering because the efficiency
characterization is independent of the actual resources. Of course, if new
constraints are added to a constraint set, it requires reordering.

<p>With the exception of resource constraints, constraint classes should
almost always involve algorithms with good complexity properties, typically
algorithms linear in the number of URIs, or better. In contrast, resource
constraints may apply <i>any</i> algorithm to the resource body, and
consequently, may require secondary ordering to ensure that cheap resource
constraints prune down the candidate URIs to a minimum before more expensive
ones are applied.  Additionally, the computational cost of resource
constraints may depend on the actual content of the resource. Neither
secondary ordering of resource constraints nor constraint ordering informed by
their content has been implemented.

<h3><li> Search Process</h3>

<p>Web walking is a search process. The current W4 implementation examines a
Web region depth first with sorting of candidate URIs at each level, but not
globally. Extensions for breadth-first, best-first, and other global search
options are in progress.</p>

<p>The current implementation runs in a single thread.  Multiple cooperating
threads exploring different parts of the search space is also under
consideration.</p>

<h3><li> Defining Constraint Types</h3>

<p> New constraint types are defined with <code>DEFINE-CONSTRAINT-TYPE</code>.
In <a href="#definition-1">Definition 1</a>, the second argument provides the
constraint efficiency class and the documentation for the constraint.  The
third argument is the lambda list passed to the body during constraint
application.

<p><center>

</pre></code></td></tr>

that only passes a URI when Web robots are allowed on the site.</caption>
</table>
</center></p>

</ol>

<h2><li>Actions</h2>

<p>Each activity contains a set of actions that are applied to URIs that have
passed its associated constraint set. <i>Actions</i> are instances of
<i>action types</i>, whose behavior is parameterized by their arguments.  Two
general classes of <i>action types</i> are currently defined:</p>

<p><ul>

<p><li><b>Primary Actions</b> are the basic kind of action.  These perform
some operation on a URI. An example is an action that writes HTML describing
the current URI to the client stream.</p>

<p><li><b>Encapsulating Actions</b> surround primary actions and allow the
action to specify when and whether the encapsulated actions run. Examples
include actions that wrap an HTML environment around primary actions that
generate HTML output for the client (<i>e.g.,</i> enumerations, tables).</p>

</ul></p>

<ol type="A">

<h3><li> Defining Action Types</h3>

<p> Action types are defined using <code>DEFINE-ACTION-TYPE</code>.  In <a
href="#definition-2">Definition 2</a>, the second argument specifies whether
the action is a primary or encapsulating action. The third argument is the
lambda list passed into the body during action execution.

<p><center>
<a name="definition-2">
<table cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr><td>
<code>
<pre>(define-action-type
  <b>trace-headers</b>
  (:standard
    :documentation <i>"Traces the headers of accessed URIs."</i>)
  (action activity url)
  (let ((*headers* (get-resource-headers activity url))
	(stream (report-stream activity)))
    (when *headers*
      (fresh-line stream)
      (print-headers stream))))
</pre></code></td></tr>

<CAPTION ALIGN="top"><b>Definition 2:</b> Defining an action that writes the headers of the URI.</caption>
</table>
</center></p>

<p>Although the constraints used by the activity to enumerate the Web region
may cover the correct resources, it may not make sense to apply actions to
each URI. Consequently, actions will often test the URI against their own set
of constraints to select the correct action to apply to a URI, or to take no
action at all. In these cases, the scope of the Web walk can be wider than the
scope of particular actions.</p>

</ol>

<h2><li> Activities</h2>

<p><i>Activities</i> collect a set of constraints to guide a Web walk and a
set of actions that are performed on visited URIs. A Web walk is initiated by
applying the generic function <code>WALK</code> to a URI and an activity.  One
can think of an <i>activity</i> as a complex argument to a function,
containing a number of interrelated parameters that are invoked in different
ways during a recursive process. Rather than pass all these arguments
separately, here they are bundled into named objects that can be reused.

<ol type="A">

<h3><li>Defining Activities</h3>

<p>Activities can be defined with <code>DEFINE-ACTIVITY</code> or they can be
created on the fly with the macro <code>WITH-ACTIVITY</code>. In each case,
textual specifications for constraints and actions are passed to routines that
allocate corresponding objects used during the walk. <a
href="#definition-3">Definition 3</a> shows how an activity is defined to
display the headers of all resources within two hyperlinks from a root URI.
The action <code>WALK-INFERIORS</code> is a built-in action that reinvokes the
interpreter on the current URI to explore the next level of the search space.

</center></p>

</ol>

<h2><li>Applications</h2>

<p> Several simple applications were implemented to test the W4 framework for
constraint-guided Web walking.  These applications are independently useful
and comprise a start on a library of actions.

<ol type="A">

<h3><li> Web Mapper</h3>

<p>A simple application walks Web structures under a set of constraints and
displays the resources traversed. This Web mapper is useful for viewing the
link branching structure associated with a Web document and for testing
constraint formulae to see what web region they select. This link mapper is
invoked via a form over HTTP and reports its results back to the Web Client. <a
href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> shows the form that invokes the Web mapper. Some
parameters for several standard constraints are captured via form input
fields, whereas more specialized constraints are passed in via the constraints
field.  In <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>, a conditional constraint is used
to suppress any HTML resources which were created before January 1, 1996
(specified in seconds since 1900). Consequently, the
results shown in <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> contain no HTML resources
modified less recently than January 1, 1996.

<table>
<tr><td><img src="map-links.gif" BORDER=3></td></tr>
<CAPTION ALIGN="top"><b>Figure 2: Client displays results of mapping a Web region.</caption>
</table>
</center></p>


<h3><li> Web Document Locator</h3>

<p>As an example of the kind of application that can be rapidly developed
using this web-walker, we developed a constraint-guided search tool.  This
tool performs a local best-first search on the area of the Web satisfying the
specified constraints.  The search employs the Salton (1980; 1991) algorithm
for classifying documents according to keywords; a document score is computed
by summing normalized frequency counts for the keywords.  The algorithm is
quite simple, as follows:  given a URI, the corresponding document is scored
(if text) and returned if the score is above a threshold.  Then, a score is
computed for all of the documents pointed to by links in the current document.
These scores are used to order the links for traversal.  The process then
continues until the applicable section of Web-space is exhausted (typically by
a constraint on the depth of the search).</p>

<center>
<a name="figure-3">
<table>
<tr><td><img src="search-form.gif" BORDER=3></td></tr>
<CAPTION ALIGN="top"><b>Figure 3:</b> Form to specify a Salton-style search over a Web region.</caption>
</table>
</center>

<p>One of the most important aspects to note about this application is the
relative ease with which it was developed.  Leveraging the substrate provided
by the CL-HTTP server and the elegant constraint structure of the walker
described herein, the code for this application is minimal beyond the actual
scoring code and some pretty-printing to provide a forms interface (see
figures below).  Using this substrate, it should be clear that arbitrary
search methodologies employing arbitrary document scoring algorithms can be
implemented rapidly and easily.</p>


<center>
<a name="figure-4">
<table>
<tr><td><img src="search-results.gif" BORDER=3></td></tr>
<CAPTION ALIGN="top"><b>Figure 4:</b> Client displays results of a Salton-style search over a Web region.</caption>
</table>
</center>

<p>Later improvements to this application will enable better scoring
techniques than the Salton algorithm as well as improving on the search
control; because the descent sorting is local, the current algorithm presumes
a fairly high degree of informational coherence on the site(s) being walked.
It would be better to sort the links for descent based on the score of the
branch of the walk tree that link belongs to; a global best-first search.</p>


<h3><li> Web Archiver</h3>

<p>The W4 Constraint-Guided Web-Walker can be configured for use as a
World-Wide Web archiving tool.  When the walker processes a node, the archiver
stores the URI content on the local file-system, creating directories that
mirror the URI hierarchy.  HTML documents are passed through a parser that
remaps hyperlink information to the file-system, allowing the user to navigate
the structure with a conventional web browser.  Hyperlinks pointing to URIs on
other hosts are preserved, allowing a seamless transition back to the web when
a resource is not mirrored locally.</p>

<p>The archiver activity is guided by a fairly simple set of constraints,
consisting of a URI-host, allowed content-types and a maximum depth.  When
mirroring a subtree on a large site, a maximum depth setting is important
since documents often reference the top node of a site.  Given an initial
pathname on the local file-system, the archiver creates a directory whose name
is a unique representation for the target host.  The URI hierarchy is then
mirrored beneath this directory.</p>

<p>The data from a cached HTML document is passed through a stream-based
parser/remapper before being output to disk.  If a BASE element is found, its
original value is stored and a local file pathname put in its place.  If no
BASE reference exists, one is created.  Since most browsers fail to correctly
parse a file reference in a BASE element, the pathname can only be specified
up to the directory representing the remote host.  Any path information from
the original BASE element must be added to each individual hyperlink
reference.  If an absolute URI reference points to a location on the host
being walked, it is parsed to a relative URI.  If it points to a location on
another host, the full URI is retained.  Once the BASE element and all
hyperlink references have been remapped in this manner, an HTTP browser can
successfully navigate the file structure on disk.</p>

<p>An archiving walker has several immediate applications:</p>

<p><ul>

<p><li><b>Resource Retrieval:</b>The archiver can be configured to fetch
particular types of resources from a host, such as images or audio files.</p>

<p><li><b>Disconnected Web for Mobile Computing:</b> The archiver provides the
ability to archive a region of the web, and then, browse it while disconnected
from the network.The archiver maintains a hash-table of document headers, so
that individual documents can be refreshed as needed when a network connection
is reestablished.</p>

<p><li><b>Historical Snapshots:</b> Another application is historical
archiving of web sites.  This is especially important for transient sites,
such as those containing political information or pertaining to a particular
event, as well as sites with a high turn-over.</p>

<p><li><b>Asynchronous Notification:</b> By observing changes in resource
modification dates and comparing sources to an archived copy, the archiver
could also provide an altering service for resources of interest.

</ul></p>

</ol>

<h2><li>Future Work</h2>

<p>The present implementation lacks a number of desirable features that will
be incorporated over the coming months.</p>

<p><ul>

<p><li> <b>Search Control:</b> Activities will be able to select and fully
customize the search process used to expand the Web structure.</p>

<p><li> <b>HTTP 1.1 Compatibility:</b> The base client will be enhanced to
support persistent connections and other aspects of HTTP 1.1 that improve
performance and reduce consumption of network resources.</p>

<p><li> <b>Multi-Threading:</b> Activities will be able to specify regimes to
partition the search space among several cooperating threads.</p>

<p><li> <b>Robust Operation:</b> The network is an unreliable place and there
are many HTTP implementations of dubious quality, not to mention bad HTML.
Exception handling will be extended to make W4 robust in the face of
ubiquitous error.</p>

<p><li> <b>Libraries:</b> As the user community develops, we hope that shared
constraints and actions can be collected and distributed with W4.</p>

</ul></p>

<h2><li>Conclusions</h2>

<p>A flexible constraint-posting architecture for graph walking from the field
of knowledge representation has been transferred to the domain of Web walking.
The architecture defines an interpreter that accepts declarative constraint
formulae which it uses to filter URIs to which declarative actions are
applied. The constraint abstraction makes possible sorting of constraints
according to their computational efficiency. This not only allows the Web
walker to proceed at a faster pace, but more importantly, it allows irrelevant
structure to be ignored.  Declarative actions allow multiple tasks to be
performed in single walks, which thereby reduces utilization of network
resources. Both constraints and actions can be collected in named activities
that can be recalled when needed again.

<p>W4 provides an environment for creating and reusing abstractions that
describe regions of the World Wide Web and perform actions over them.  The
initial vocabulary provided with W4 can be extended to support intelligent
agents performing resource discovery on the Web.

<h2><li> Availability</h2>

<p>The present implementation is about 3000 lines of Common Lisp code, not
including the applications.  It runs on the same platforms as the Common Lisp
Web Server.  The source code will be distributed with the web server in future
releases.

<dt><B>If</B> <i>[Circumstance-Constraint]:</i> <code>(ANTECEDENT CONSEQUENT ALTERNATE)</code>
<dd>This constraint allows conditional branching
in the constraint structure. If ANTECEDENT succeeds, CONSEQUENT is applied,
otherwise ALTERNATE is applied. The success or failure of CONSEQUENT or
ALTERNATE determine the overall success or failure of the expression.
Each of these components can be either a single constraint or a constraint set.


<dt><B>No-Cycles</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>()</code> <dd>Succeeds for
URIs that have not been walked during the current activity.


<dt><B>Not</B> <i>[Circumstance-Constraint]:</i> <code>(CONSTRAINT-SET-OR-CONSTRAINT)</code>

<dt><B>Or</B> <i>[Circumstance-Constraint]:</i> <code>(&amp;REST CONSTRAINTS)</code>
<dd>Succeeds if any of its arguments succeed, otherwise fails.
The arguments are any combination of constraints or constraint sets. They are
evaluated left to right.

Fails if the content is not text. This is case insensitive.


<dt><B>URI-Class</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>(CLASS)</code>
<dd>Succeeds when the URI is of class of a URI. Class is the object class for
the URI scheme.

<dt><B>URI-Directory-Path</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i>
<code>(DIRECTORY-PATH)</code> <dd>Succeeds when the URI directory components
are exactly the same as DIRECTORY-PATH.  DIRECTORY-PATH is a list of directory
components.  This is case insensitive.


<dt><B>URI-Extension</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>(EXTENSION)</code>
<dd>Succeeds when extension component of URI is EXTENSION.
Fails for URIs that are not objects, e.g., paths.  This is case insensitive.


<dt><B>URI-Host</B> <i>[DNS-URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>(HOST)</code>
<dd>Succeeds when the URI refers to the host HOST.
HOST can be a list of primary HOST domain names.


<dt><B>URI-Name</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>(NAME)</code> <dd>Succeeds
when name component of URI is NAME.  Fails for URIs that are not objects,
e.g., paths.  This is case insensitive.


<dt><B>URI-Parent-Subsumed-By-Directory-Path</B> <i>[URI-Constraint]:</i> <code>(DIRECTORY-PATH)</code>
