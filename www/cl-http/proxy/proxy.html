CL-HTTP now provides HTTP proxy service.  Proxy functionality is integrated into
the existing system architecture, so CL-HTTP may act as a proxy without 
interrupting normal server operations.  When CL-HTTP receives a request for a 
remote resource, it may utilize the client module and relay the information to the
client.  Proxy access is controlled via a top-level switch as well as a list 
of allowed subnets.  The current release also includes an experimental caching proxy 
mode.  Caching support is optional and is controlled by a separate server preference.

<a name="relay"> <h2><li> Proxy Relay</h2>

<p> Proxy relay (no caching) service can be provided for all standard HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 methods. The
HTTP/1.0 PUT extension is not supported. Access to basic proxy services is controlled via <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3A*PROXY-SERVICE*">http:*proxy-service*</a> and <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3A*PROXY-SUBNETS*">http:*proxy-subnets*</a>. The proxy uses
the standard CL-HTTP client to retrieve resources, and the default HTTP version used for making such requests is
controlled by <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3A*CLIENT-HTTP-VERSION*">http:*client-http-version*</a>. The
relay methods are intended to be HTTP/1.1 compliant, and discrepancies should be reported (or fixed!) when
encountered. </p>

<a name="caching"> <h2><li> Caching</h2>

<p><img src="/cl-http/icons/construction6.gif" alt="Construction" align="left"> Proxy access to the experimental
caching routines is controlled via <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3A*PROXY-CACHING-P*">http:*proxy-caching-p*</a>. The current
version of the cache uses in-memory data structures to store meta-information about cached representations of
resources, and the file-system to store their actual entities. The file HTTP:proxy;database.lisp illustrates how to
define new database implementations. While the caching functionality is not yet HTTP/1.1 compliant, it
interoperates reasonably with HTTP/1.0 clients.</p>

<p> If the proxy is currently loaded, you can view a list of the <a href="cached-resource?">cached resources</a>
on the server. Note that the cache currently does not automatically expunge itself to make more space. However,
methods such as <a href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3ACACHE-SIZE">http:cache-size</a> and <a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP%3AEXPUNGE-CACHE">http:expunge-cache</a> allow such a strategy to
be implemented. You may wish to run a seperate process that attempts to keep the cache size within a certain
window.</p>

<a name="future"> <h2><li>Continuing Work</h2>

<p><img src="/cl-http/icons/red-cross.gif" alt="First Aid" align="left" > As with the rest of the server, we need
the help of the CL-HTTP community to push this functionality forward. Most changes to the relay methods should be
in the form of bug fixes or efficiency imporovements. The caching methods in HTTP:proxy;proxy-cache.lisp need to
be further abstracted and moved closer to HTTP/1.1 compliance.</p>

<p>
As of August 1997, these are some of the issues:</p>

<p>
<ol>

<li> Parsing of search URLs causes conflicts with the proxy, we are developing a new 
strategy for parsing (or parsing less of) identifiers for remote resources.
<li> Need to avoid parsing most headers on proxying, for efficiency and to avoid a 
whole class of header-parsing conflicts.  This will involve changes to the header and client code.
<li> Support for more conditional methods.
<li> Support for HTTP/1.1 cache control.
<li> Add cache sensitivity to HTTP/1.1 byte-range requests.
<li> Efficient/intelligent methods for computing cache size and expunge order, as well
as a standard expunge policy.
<li> Ensure that error handling is correct for caching methods.
<li>  Consider resource contention issues more closely (actually implement bimodal locks on the Mac.)
<li> Make sure that chunk decoding is not causing premature exit of some code.

</ol>

<a name="extensions"> <h2><li> Extensions</h2>

<p>This proxy is meant more as a platform for intelligent caching and collaboration research than a competitor for
high-load corporate proxies. Several immediate oppurtunities present themselves.</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Cache Prefetch</b>
<dd>The proxy cache can be used along with the 
    <a href="/cl-http/w4/w4.html">W4 Web Walker</a> to implement prefetch operations.
<dt><b>Collaborative Browsing</b>
<dd>The proxy may be used to infer group browsing patterns and aid in resource discovery.
<dt><b>Annotation</b>
<dd>The cache may act as a platform for group annotation of resources.
<dt><b>Intelligent Caching</b>
<dd>CL-HTTP should provide an excellent environment for research in dynamic caching algorithms.
