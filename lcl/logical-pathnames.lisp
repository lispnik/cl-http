;;; Logical Pathnames System ***************************************
;;; ****************************************************************
;;;
;;; Logical Pathnames provide a facility for referring to pathnames
;;; in a portable manner. Logical pathnames are mapped to physical
;;; pathnames by a set of implementation dependent and site-dependent
;;; rules. 
;;; 
;;; This system is a Common Lisp portable implementation of logical
;;; pathnames. It fulfills most of the X3J13 June 1989 specification
;;; for logical pathnames, as documented in Guy Steele's "Common Lisp:
;;; The Language" (2nd Edition), section 23.1.5 "Logical Pathnames".

;;; Change Log *********************
;;; ********************************
;;;
;;; djc  = Daniel J. Clancy <clancy@cs.utexas.edu>
;;;
;;; 30-JUL-90  mk    Fixed logical pathnames for VAX-LISP (thanks to
;;;                  Paul Werkowski). In VAX-LISP simple strings are not
;;;                  sub-types of simple-vectors, so svref doesn't work
;;;                  on strings. These calls have been fixed to read
;;;                  #+:cmu svref #-:cmu aref.
;;; 15-NOV-90  mk    Changed convert-file-function to better handle optional 
;;;                  args. This should fix the problem of (ed) and (dribble)
;;;                  returning errors like "argument NIL must be a number"
;;;                  in parse-namestring. Note that some lisps seem to make
;;;                  a distinction between (funcall #'foo) and (foo) with
;;;                  respect to this error.
;;; 29-JAN-91  mk    Defined LISP:NTH-VALUE if not already present (it is
;;;                  a CLtL2 addition) and used it in LOAD-PHYSICAL-HOSTAB
;;;                  to avoid needing a GARBAGE variable in 
;;;                  (multiple-value-setq (garbage pos) ...) which we can
;;;                  not declare ignore and yet causes a compiler warning
;;;                  since we don't use it.
;;; 29-JAN-91  mk    lisp::file-name is particular to CMU Common Lisp
;;;                  and the #+:cmu's were accidentally left off.
;;; 29-JAN-91  mk    Added :explorer physical namestring output to 
;;;                  PHYSICAL-NAMESTRING.                
;;; 29-JAN-91  mk    Warns about name collisions between physical and logical
;;;                  host names.
;;; 30-JAN-91  mk    Added :logical-pathnames-mk to the *features* list.
;;; 25-FEB-91  mk    Added definition of LOAD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS.
;;; 09-APR-91  mk    Export pathname-host-type, append-logical-directories.
;;; 09-APR-91  mk    Translation rules now support :case :unchanged.
;;; 09-APR-91  djc   Fixed so that (logical-pathname "") returns a 
;;;                  logical-pathname structure.
;;; 12-JUL-91 mk    Changed wildcarding to bring it into closer conformance
;;;                 with reversible wildcard translation, and to make it
;;;                 easier for the user to customize the behavior.
;;;  8-JAN-92 mk    Upgraded packages to work in CLtL2 compatible lisps too.
;;; 20-MAY-92 mk    No longer define NTH-VALUE in the Lisp package to avoid
;;;                 name conflicts in Lucid, because the symbol is defined in
;;;                 the CLIM-LISP using package.
;;; 20-MAY-92 mk    Logical pathnames now have a default host specified by the
;;;                 variable *default-logical-pathname-host*.


;;; ********************************
;;; To Do **************************
;;; ********************************
;;;
;;; should really define *default-logical-pathname-defaults* to avoid
;;; problems with *default-pathname-defaults*.
;;;
;;; Support for Macintosh pathnames. Little tricky, since MACL uses a
;;; colon (:) as the delimiter.
;;;    
;;; support for tops-20/tenex, multics, its, ms-dos
;;; add host-type to pathnames
;;; merge-pathnames, with-open-file 
;;;
;;; Define generic pathname parsing/printing definition interface.
;;;
;;; Redefine with-open-file?
;;;
;;; Port to emacs-lisp for gnu-emacs?
;;;
;;; Logical pathnames needs to case both on the physical host type and on
;;; lisp type (e.g., for canonicalization). Fix this, and define lots of
;;; canonical types. Dependency on lisp type can probably be handled using
;;; #+ and #-. What about conflicts between canonicalization and the
;;; translations (e.g., "L" vs :lisp)?
;;;

;;; ********************************
;;; Notes **************************

;;;    LOGICAL-PATHNAMES has been tested (successfully) in the following lisps:

;;; ********************************
;;; Documentation ******************
;;; ********************************
;;; 
;;; Logical pathnames allow large programs to be moved between sites
;;; by separating pathname reference from actual file location. The
;;; program will refer to files using logical pathnames. At each site,
;;; a user will specify a set of "translations" which map from the logical
;;; pathnames to the physical pathnames used on the device.
;;;
;;; Logical pathnames provide a uniform convention for filesystem access,
;;; with the following properties:
;;;  1.  Pathname Portability: The program specifies a pathname in
;;;      a conventional format (logical pathnames), which may be
;;;      mapped reasonably literally (via the translations) to
;;;      a variety of filesystems.
;;;  2.  Pathname Aliasing: The files may exist in different locations
;;;      in the various filesystems. For example, the root directory
;;;      might change. The translations allow such a change easily.
;;;  3.  Cross-host Access: The files need not all exist on the same
;;;      physical host. 
;;;
;;; This definition of logical pathnames provides support for physical
;;; pathnames for Unix, VMS/VAX, Symbolics, and TI Explorers, and is
;;; easily extended to handle additional platforms. Code which may need
;;; customization for particular Lisps and platforms has been commented
;;; with three ampersands (&&&). In addition, the user probably should
;;; define their own canonical types, translation rules, and
;;; logical-pathname-translations. Examples are provided.
;;;
;;; Logical pathnames employ the following syntax:
;;;     [host:] [;] {directory ;}* [name] [. type [. version]]
;;; host      ::= word
;;; directory ::= word | wildcard-word | wildcard-inferiors
;;; name      ::= word | wildcard-word
;;; type      ::= word | wildcard-word
;;; version   ::= word | wildcard-word
;;; word      ::= {letter | digit | -}*
;;; wildcard-word ::= [word] * {word *}* [word]
;;; wildcard-inferiors ::= **
;;;
;;; A wildcard-word of * parses as :wild; all others as strings. These
;;; definitions may be extended (e.g., "newest" parsing as :newest) by
;;; defining new canonical types.
;;;
;;; Incompatibilities with the X3J13 specification:
;;;    -  LOGICAL-PATHNAME is not defined as a subclass of PATHNAME
;;;       since we have no guarrantee about the format of PATHNAME
;;;       (i.e., is it a defstruct or a class definition, what are
;;;       its slots, etc.). Many Lisps will be able to replace the
;;;       definition of PHYSICAL-PATHNAME with their definition of
;;;       PATHNAME by doing a string-replace of "physical-pathname"
;;;       with "pathname" and deleting some definitions from this file.
;;;    -  CLtL does not specify the manner in which wildcards are
;;;       translated. We use reversible wildcard pathname translation,
;;;       similar to that used in the Symbolics logical pathnames.
;;;    -  COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME has not been defined, since it is
;;;       highly implementation dependent.

;;; ********************************
;;; Examples ***********************
;;; ********************************
;;;
;;; The following examples of the use of logical pathnames are taken
;;; from Section 23.1.5.4 of Guy Steele CLtL 2nd Ed.

;;; ********************************
;;; Pathname Defstruct *************
;;; ********************************
;;;
;;; We define a generic physical pathname (physical-pathname defstruct) because
;;; we have absolutely NO guarrantees about the structure of pathnames.
;;; Pathnames may be defstructs or classes, and the slots may have arbitrary
;;; types, especially with respect to the directory slot. Depending on the
;;; lisp, the directory slot may be a list, vector, simple-vector,
;;; string, keyword, or nil. If a list or vector, the items in the list
;;; may be strings, keywords (for canonical types), or nil. The first item
;;; in the list may or may not be a special keyword (e.g., :relative and
;;; :absolute). 
;;;
;;; The lack of a common interface to pathnames means that any implementation
;;; of logical pathnames must parse and generate the pathname (namestring)
;;; formats for a variety of file-servers. We can't simply rely on the
;;; lisp's implementation of the PATHNAME defstruct, because that does not
;;; necessarily handle the formats of file-servers of a different type 
;;; (translations may be in the format of the target file server). Also,
;;; inconsistency in the implementation of the PATHNAME type means that we
;;; would have to special case most of the code for each and every lisp.
;;;
;;; Instead, we parse the pathnames into a common format (the physical-pathname
;;; defstruct), from which we generate a namestring in a format acceptable
;;; to the underlying lisp. The namestring (which is a string in *all* the
;;; lisps) serves as the interface to the lisp's implementation of pathnames.
;;;
;;; As it currently stands, X3J13's spec for logical pathnames tries to 
;;; accomplish two distinct goals:
;;;    (1) isolate pathname reference from actual file location (logical
;;;        as opposed to physical pathnames) 
;;;    (2) provide a common format for namestring syntax and 
;;;        pathname structure
;;; This is trying to accomplish too much within a single framework. Instead,
;;; the second goal should be decoupled from logical pathnames and made a 
;;; requirement for pathnames in general. 
;;;
;;; In other words, let there be a standard namestring syntax and a fully
;;; specified structure for physical pathnames (not just logical pathnames).
;;; This standard should subsume the requirements of all current lisps, and
;;; the individual lisp implementation should worry about interfacing with
;;; the file system. There is no good reason why a programmer should have
;;; to know the peculiarities of a filesystem when writing software. The X3J13
;;; spec just shoves it under the rug, forcing the programmer to deal with
;;; it when writing the translations file. 
;;;
;;; Because there is no standard for pathnames, we're forced into a situation
;;; where different lisps running on the same physical host may have
;;; different namestring syntaxes, so knowing the physical host type is not
;;; a guarrantee of the pathname syntax.
