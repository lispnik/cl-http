BUFFERED-STREAM-MIXIN is the abstract mixin one of whose subclasses should be
mixed in to your class. Its STREAM-IO-BUFFER accessor is an IO-BUFFER structure
instance. The INITIALIZE-INSTANCE method for BUFFERED-STREAM-MIXIN sets up the
IO-BUFFER. If you need to store other stuff, you can :INCLUDE IO-BUFFER in
your own structure and set the STREAM-IO-BUFFER slot to your instance before
CALL-NEXT-METHOD in your INITIALIZE-INSTANCE method.

The subclasses of BUFFERED-STREAM-MIXIN and the methods specialized on them are
as follows. BUFFERED-STREAM-MIXIN, BUFFERED-INPUT-STREAM-MIXIN, and
BUFFERED-OUTPUT-STREAM-MIXIN are abstract classes. You should mix in one
or more of the other classes. The default methods should be useable as is
unless you need to do filtering on the data.

Generic functions that fill and empty the buffers and
provide eof and data available information. You need to
specialize these on your stream class. Most of them do
not have a default method.

INITIALIZE-INSTANCE stream &key insize outsize share-buffers-p
  Initializes (STREAM-IO-BUFFER stream). Allocates an instance
  of IO-BUFFER if the slot is not already set. If it is set,
  it should be a structure instance that :INCLUDE's IO-BUFFER.
  If INSIZE (OUTSIZE) is non-NIL, it is the number of bytes to
  allocate for the input (output) buffer. If SHARE-BUFFERS-P is
  true, causes a single buffer to be shared between input and output.

STREAM-CLOSE :after stream
  Deallocates the buffers if they were allocated by INITIALIZE-INSTANCE.

IO-BUFFER-ADVANCE stream io-buffer readp
  Called when there is no data in the input buffer.
  If readp is true, this is a request for data:
    Either fill IO-BUFFER-INBUF with data
    or %SETF-MACPTR it to the new buffer (for non-copying reads).
    And set IO-BUFFER-INCOUNT to the number of bytes in the buffer.
    Also, (%setf-macptr io-buffer-inptr io-buffer-inbuf).
    Return true if there are new bytes to read, false if end-of-file.
    Don't return unless you've gotten more data or the stream is at end-of-file.
  If readp is false, this is a notification that the input buffer has
  been used up. If this is a doing non-copying input, release the input
  buffer. You can read more here if you want to, but it's best not to block.
    
IO-BUFFER-LISTEN stream io-buffer
  Return true if there is data ready to read.
  If you modify io-buffer-inbuf, then (%setf-macptr io-buffer-inptr io-buffer-inbuf).

IO-BUFFER-EOFP stream io-buffer
  Return true if the stream is at end-of-file.

IO-BUFFER-FORCE-OUTPUT stream io-buffer count finish-p
  Write count bytes from IO-BUFFER-OUTBUF.
   (%SETF-MACPTR IO-BUFFER-OUTBUF ...) if you are doing non-copying writes.
  Also, (%setf-macptr io-buffer-outptr io-buffer-outbuf).
  Set IO-BUFFER-OUTCOUNT to the number of bytes in the (possibly new) output buffer.
    If you're not doing non-copying-writes this will be IO-BUFFER-OUTSIZE.
  If finish-p is true, you should finish the output before returning.
