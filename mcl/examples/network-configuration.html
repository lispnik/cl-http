<h1> Setting Up A Local Private Network for CL-HTTP<br> on Ethernet-attached
Macintosh Systems</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Macintosh users are, as a rule, unaccustomed to dealing with
network configuration. Normally, they either connect their
machine to an AppleTalk network which is self-configuring, 
or to an existing TCP/IP network, with configuration instructions
and support offered by the network provider.

This document describes how to set up a local private network
upon which you can run a CL-HTTP server and make it available
to all hosts on that network.

I assume that you have already acquired and installed the current
release of CL-HTTP, and that your Macintosh is connected to a
local Ethernet network which is used only for AppleTalk traffic
to support file sharing and other local applications. (These
instructions will most likely work with other kinds of network
connections, such as LocalTalk, if you make the obvious
adjustments — I, however, have not attempted this.)

These instructions must not be used if your Macintosh is already
configured to use TCP/IP on your local network (as opposed
to using TCP/IP over a dial-up connection) or if your network
contains routers.

If you follow these instructions, you'll be able to access your
CL-HTTP server from your own machine, and will be able to
easily allow server access from other hosts on your private
network.

<h2>Required Software</h2>

You should have successfully compiled the current version of
CL-HTTP (version 60-57 as of this writing) on the current version
(4.0 as of this writing) of Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL.)

In addition to CL-HTTP, you must have installed the current
versions of the Macintosh OS (version 7.5.5 as of this writing) and
Open Transport (version 1.1.2 as of this writing.)

You'll also need to download MacDNS (version 1.4 as of this
writing) from http://cybertech.apple.com/MacDNS.html . 

<h2>Instructions</h2>

First, you need to give your Macintosh an IP address. Open the
TCP/IP control panel and select Configurations… from the File
menu. Select an existing configuration name and click the
Duplicate… button. Give the new configuration the name
“Local” and click the OK button. Now click the Make Active 
button. This creates a new configuration, which you’ll modify 
specifically for your computer.

Still in the TCP/IP control panel, select User Mode… from the
Edit menu, click the Advanced button, then the OK button.
Doing this shows all of the information fields in the configuation
dialog.

Now make the following settings in the TCP/IP configuration 
dialog (the name TCP/IP (Local) should appear in window title.)

<pre>Connect via: Ethernet
Configure: Manually
IP Address: 10.1.1.1
Subnet Mask: this field must be empty
Router Address: this field must be empty
Name Server Addr.: 10.1.1.1
Starting domain name: apple-talk.net
Ending domain name: this field must be empty
Additional search domains: this field must be empty
Use 802.3: should be unchecked</pre>

(Please don’t substitute other numbers for the IP address.
Network 10 is specifically reserved for private networks. Using
this network minimizes the chance of your inadvertently
disrupting someone else’s network service.)

Now click the Options… button. The TCP/IP Options dialog will
appear; click the Active button, then the OK button.

Finally, close the configuration dialog. You may be told that you
haven’t entered a subnet mask, and that an appropriate default
will be provided; this is exactly what you want.

So far, you've established an IP address of 10.1.1.1 for your
computer, and have specified that your computer will host the
name server for your private network.

Now you need to set up the name server. Start MacDNS, and
select New Zone File… from the File menu. Fill in the zone
information as follows.

<pre>
Domain Name: apple-talk.net.
Primary Server: .
Secondary Server: this field must be empty
Administrator: administrator@apple-talk.net
</pre>
(Note that the Domain Name ends with a period, and the Primary 
Server field contains a single period.)

Now select Add Permanent Host… from the Hosts menu. Fill in
the host information as follows.

<pre>
Host Name: local-host.apple-talk.net.
IP Address: 10.1.1.1
Aliases: see below
</pre>

(Note that the Host Name ends with a period. You may specify
additional names for your system in the Aliases field; they must
all have the same domain name, end with a period, and be
separated from each other by commas.)

Close the hosts dialog, then save your DNS configuration by
selecting Save… from the File menu. Do not close the window.

At this point, you will be able to start CL-HTTP and have it serve
pages to a web browser on your machine. Do this by starting MCL
and loading the file mac-start-server.lisp . This will load the
files you’ve already compiled (or compile and load them if this is
the first time) and then start the server. You’ll be able to tell that
the server is running when you see its log window, which has the
title Mac Common Lisp HTTP Log (Local-Host.Apple-Talk.Net) .
The first line of the log should tell you that the HTTP service has
been enabled.

Now start your web browser, and specify the following URL.

http://local-host.apple-talk.net/

Your web browser should load and display the CL-HTTP online
documentation. Depending upon your brower and the speed of
your Macintosh, you may notice a significant delay while the page
is loaded. This is because both the server and the browser are being
run on the same Macintosh, which has certain implications.

Both programs are competing for the same CPU cycles to transfer
and display the page. This is aggravated by the fact that the server
runs in the background and must yield the CPU frequently to the
browser in the foreground; this is a design feature of the Macintosh
OS. Second, your browser may not yield CPU cycles often enough
to the server running in the background; this is a design flaw in the
browser. In extreme cases, the browser may not yield the CPU at
all during certain operations, which may prevent the server from
responding. When this happens, the browser will be completely
unresponsive and you will have to force it to quit (press and hold 
the command, option, and escape keys.) This actually happened
in an older version of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, but does not
seem to be a problem in the latest versions of Netscape Navigator
(version 3.01), NCSA Mosaic (version 3.0b4), Apple Cyberdog (version
2.0a1), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0.)

Adding Other Hosts

To establish access to your CL-HTTP server from other Macintosh
systems on your private network, you must give each Macintosh a
unique IP address, a named entry in your DNS, and a reference to
your DNS server.

First, decide what the IP address and name will be for each new
machine. Neither the IP address nor the name can be shared by any
other machine on your network. It's probably a good idea to assign
IP addresses consecutively, begining at 10.1.1.2 (remember that your
machine already has the address 10.1.1.1.)

On your machine (the one running CL-HTTP and MacDNS), add
permanent host entries in MacDNS as you did for your machine,
but with distinct IP addresses and names for each new host. When
you are done, save the changed zone file, but do not close it.

Now take your list of IP addresses and names to each machine, and
configure using the TCP/IP control panel. You will follow the same
procedure that you used on the server machine, but with a different
IP address for each machine. It is important that you always specify
the name server address as 10.1.1.1; this is the IP address of your DNS
server. Don't make the mistake of entering another machine’s
address in this field!

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If the above doesn’t work, first double-check all of the settings. It is
quite easy to mistype a value, and the TCP/IP software can’t provide
much of a defense against this kind of error. 

If a file named Hosts exists in your system folder, open it to see
whether it contains a conflicting host definition. You may have
added such a definition during a previous attempt to configure your
machine as a CL-HTTP server. The following two lines define  an
IP address of 1.2.3.4 for the same name we’ve established for the
server using MacDNS.

Local-Host.Apple-Talk.net.	A		1.2.3.4
local-host.				CNAME	Local-Host.Apple-Talk.Net.

(Do not insert these lines into your Hosts file!)

Because the Hosts file has precedence, this will cause lookups to fail.
Remove the offending entry and reboot your Macintosh.

Make sure that you start CL-HTTP by loading mac-start-server.lisp .
You should not use mac-start-local-talk.lisp .

<h2>Changing Configurations</h2>

To shut down your CL-HTTP server (e.g. to dial in to your ISP),
first quit MCL; this will stop the CL-HTTP server. Next quit MacDNS.
Finally, open the TCP/IP control panel, select Configurations… from
the File menu, select the desired configuration, click the Make
Active button, and close the configuration dialog. You do not need
to reboot your Macintosh for the changes to take effect.

To restart your CL-HTTP server at a later time, use the TCP/IP
control panel to select your local network configuration, then start
MacDNS, then start the CL-HTTP server.
