Status of This Document</H2>
This draft specification is a work in progress representing the current
consensus of the W3C RDF Model and Syntax Working Group. This is a W3C
Working Draft for review by W3C members and other interested parties. Publication
as a working draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C membership. While
the design has stabilized quite a bit since the previous version and we
do not anticipate substantial changes, we still caution that further changes
are possible and therefore we recommend that only experimental software
or software that can be easily field-upgraded be implemented to this specification
at this time. The RDF Model and Syntax Working Group will not allow early
implementation to constrain their ability to make changes to this specification
prior to final release. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced
or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite
W3C Working Drafts as other than "work in progress".

<P><B>Note:</B> As working drafts are subject to frequent change, you are
advised to reference the above URL for "Latest version" rather than the
URLs for specific working draft versions themselves. The latest version
URL will always point to the most current version of this draft.

<P>Comments on this specification may be sent to <A HREF="mailto:www-rdf-comments@w3.org">www-rdf-comments@w3.org</A>.

<A NAME="intro"></A>1. Introduction</H2>
RDF &shy; the Resource Description Framework &shy; is a foundation for
processing metadata; it provides interoperability between applications
that exchange machine-understandable information on the Web. RDF emphasizes
facilities to enable automated processing of Web resources. RDF metadata
can be used in a variety of application areas; for example: in <I>resource
discovery</I> to provide better search engine capabilities; in <I>cataloging</I>
for describing the content and content relationships available at a particular
Web site, page, or digital library; by <I>intelligent software agents</I>
to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange; in <I>content rating</I>;
in describing <I>collections</I> of pages that represent a single logical
"document"; for describing <I>intellectual property rights</I> of Web pages,
and in many others. RDF with <I>digital signatures</I> will be key to building
the "Web of Trust" for electronic commerce, collaboration, and other applications.

<P>Metadata is "data about data" or specifically in the context of RDF
"data describing web resources". The distinction between "data" and "metadata"
is not an absolute one; it is a distinction created primarily by a particular
application. Many times the same resource will be interpreted in both ways
simultaneously. RDF encourages this view by using XML as the encoding syntax
for the metadata. The resources being described by RDF are, in general,
anything that can be named via a URI. The broad goal of RDF is to define
a mechanism for describing resources that makes no assumptions about a
particular application domain, nor defines the semantics of any application
domain. The definition of the mechanism should be domain neutral, yet the
mechanism should be suitable for describing information about any domain.

<P>This document introduces a model for representing RDF metadata and one
syntax for expressing and transporting this metadata in a manner that maximizes
the interoperability of independently developed web servers and clients.
The syntax described in this document is best considered as a "serialization
syntax" for the underlying RDF representation model. The serialization
syntax uses the eXtensible Markup Language [<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</A>].
RDF and XML are complementary; there will be alternate ways to represent
the same RDF data model, some more suitable for direct human authoring.
Future work may lead to including such alternatives in this document.
<H2>
<A NAME="model"></A>2. RDF Data Model</H2>
At the core of RDF is a model for representing named properties and their
values. These properties serve both to represent attributes of resources
(and in this sense correspond to usual attribute-value pairs) and to represent
relationships between resources. The RDF data model is a syntax-independent
way of representing RDF expressions. This specification shows three representations
of the data model; as 3-tuples, as a graph, and in XML. These representations
have equivalent meaning. The mapping between the representations used in
this specification is not intended to constrain in any way the internal
representation used by implementations.

<P>RDF expressions that are syntactically very different could mean the
same thing. This concept of equivalence in meaning is very important when
performing queries, aggregation and a number of other tasks at which RDF
is aimed. The equivalence is defined in a clean machine understandable
way. Two RDF expressions are equivalent if and only if their corresponding
data model representations are the same. Two RDF string values (defined
below) are deemed to be the same if their ISO/IEC 10646 representations
match.
<H3>
2.1. RDF Core; "Layer 0"</H3>
The core data model is precisely defined as:
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL>
<LI>
There is a set called <I>Nodes</I>.</LI>

<LI>
There is a subset of <I>Nodes</I> called <I>PropertyTypes</I>.</LI>

<LI>
There is a set of 3-tuples called <I>Triples</I>, whose elements are called
<I>properties</I>. The first item of each 3-tuple (triple) is an element
of <I>PropertyTypes</I>, the second item is an element of <I>Nodes</I>
and the third item is either an element of <I>Nodes</I> or an atomic value
(an RDF string).&nbsp;</LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
In this data model both the resources being described and the values describing
them are represented as nodes in a directed labeled graph. The arcs connecting
pairs of nodes correspond to the names of the property types. Each arc
is said to be <I>labeled</I> by the corresponding property type.

<P>As RDF serialization is written in XML, the character repertoire of
an RDF string is ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646]. An actual RDF string, whether
in an XML document or in some other representation of the RDF data model,
may be stored using a direct encoding of ISO/IEC 10646 or an encoding which
can be mapped to ISO/IEC 10646. Language tagging is part of the string
value; it is applied to sequences of characters within an RDF string and
does not have an explicit manifestation in the data model.

<P>Two RDF strings are deemed to be the same if their ISO/IEC 10646 representations
match. Each RDF application must specify which one of the following definitions
of 'match' it uses:
<OL type=a>
<LI>
the two representations are identical, or</LI>

<LI>
the two representations are canonically equivalent as defined by The Unicode
Standard [Unicode].</LI>
</OL>
The application may ignore language tagging within a string; all RDF applications
must specify whether or not language tagging in string values is significant;
that is, whether or not language is considered when performing string matching
or other processing.

<P>An RDF expression is represented pictorially in text with nodes in '[...]'
and arcs in '--...-->' as follows:
<UL>
<PRE>[resource R] ---PropertyType P--> [value V]</PRE>
</UL>
This is read "V is the value of the property type P for resource R", or
left-to-right; "R has property type P with value V".

<P>Consider as a simple example the statement:
<UL><I>Ora Lassila is the author of the resource http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila</I></UL>
This statement can be represented as follows:
<UL>
<PRE>[http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila] ---Author--> "Ora Lassila"</PRE>
</UL>
where the notation '[URI]' denotes the node representing the resource identified
by URI and quotation marks (") denote an atomic value.

<P>According to the formal definition, this property, i.e. the arc labeled
"Author" plus its source and target nodes, is the triple:
<UL>
<PRE>{Author, [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila], "Ora Lassila"}</PRE>
</UL>
where "Author" denotes a node in <I>PropertyTypes</I> that corresponds
to this arc label.

<P>A set of triples that all refer to the same node (the second item in
the triple) can be grouped as a unit called a <I>Description</I>. Descriptions
are particularly useful when specifying a number of properties of the same
resource. A Description (here containing two properties) is diagrammed
as follows:
<UL>
<PRE>[resource R] ---PropertyType P1--> [value Vp1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---PropertyType P2--> [value Vp2]

[Bag B] --------RDF:1------------> [Property P1Vp1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------RDF:2------------> [Property P2Vp2]</PRE>
</UL>
Each RDF Description has its own node (the node identified as "Bag B" in
the diagram) identifying the collection of triples, as described below.
The Description can therefore be described by properties; that is, a Description
can itself be used as the source node of other arcs describing properties
of the Description.

<P>The property types in a given Description, as well as any characteristics
or restrictions of the property values themselves, are defined by one or
more <I>schemas.</I> Each property type used in a Description is declared
to be from exactly one schema. A schema is identified by a URI. The schema
URI may be treated merely as an identifier or it may refer to a machine-understandable
description of the schema. By definition, to <I>understand</I> a particular
schema used by a Description means to understand the semantics of each
of the properties in that Description that are declared to be associated
with the schema. An application that has no knowledge of the particular
schema will still be able to parse the Description into the property type
and property value components and will be able to transport the Description
intact (e.g. to a cache or to another application).
<H3>
2.2. Utility Relations; "Layer 1"</H3>
The utility relations exist to permit Descriptions about Descriptions and
to provide definitions for collections of nodes.

<P>The triple composed of a property type, a resource, and a value is an
RDF <I>property</I>. Such a property can itself be the target node of an
arc (i.e. the value of some other property) or the source node of an arc
(i.e. it can have properties). In these cases, the original property must
be <I>reified</I>; that is, converted into additional nodes and arcs. The
term <I>reification</I> means to convert the relation expressed by the
arc into a concrete node to which we can refer. Reification allows us to
express modalities (e.g. beliefs about properties) or simply attach any
properties to other properties.

<P>For example, the reification of the expression
<UL>
<PRE>[http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila] ---Author--> "Ora Lassila"</PRE>
</UL>
is the four properties
<UL>
<PRE>[X] ---InstanceOf--> [RDF:Property]
[X] ---PropName----> [Author]
[X] ---PropObj-----> [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila]
[X] ---Value-------> "Ora Lassila"</PRE>
</UL>
That is, a node X and four new triples are added:
<UL>
<PRE>{InstanceOf, [X], [RDF:Property]}
{PropName,&nbsp;&nbsp; [X], [Author]}
{PropObj,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X], [http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila]}
{Value,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X], "Ora Lassila"}</PRE>
</UL>
Reified properties are drawn as a single node with several arcs emanating
from it representing the resource, property name, and value:
<UL>
<PRE>[property P1] ----InstanceOf-> [RDF:Property]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----PropName---> [PropertyType P]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----PropObj----> [resource R]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----Value------> [value Vp1]</PRE>
</UL>
This allows RDF to be used to make statements about other statements; for
example, the statement "Ralph believes that the document 'The Origin of
Species' was authored by Charles Darwin" is represented as:
<UL>
<PRE>[Ralph] --Believes--> [statement1] --InstanceOf-> [RDF:Property]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --PropName---> [Author]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --PropObj----> [http://loc.gov/Books/Species]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Value------> "Charles Darwin"</PRE>
</UL>
To help in reifying properties, RDF defines the <I>InstanceOf</I> relation
(property type) to provide primitive typing, as shown in the previous example.

<P>The formal definition of <I>InstanceOf</I> is:
<BR><A NAME="InstanceOf"></A>
<TABLE BORDER >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=4>
<LI>
There is an element of <I>PropertyTypes</I> known as RDF:InstanceOf.</LI>

<LI>
Elements of <I>Triples</I> that have RDF:InstanceOf as the first item in
the triple must have elements of <I>Nodes</I> as their second item and
third item.&nbsp;</LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The formal definition of reification is:
<BR><A NAME="Property"></A><A NAME="PropName"></A><A NAME="PropObj"></A><A NAME="Value"></A>
<TABLE BORDER >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=6>
<LI>
There is an element of <I>Nodes</I>, not contained in <I>PropertyTypes</I>,
known as RDF:Property.</LI>

<LI>
There are three elements in <I>PropertyTypes</I> known as RDF:PropName,
RDF:PropObj, and RDF:Value.</LI>

<LI>
The reification of an element <I>t</I> of <I>Triples</I> is an element
<I>n</I> of <I>Nodes</I> representing the reified <I>t</I> and the elements
<I>t<SUB>1</SUB></I>, <I>t<SUB>2</SUB></I>, <I>t<SUB>3</SUB></I>, and <I>t<SUB>4</SUB></I>
of <I>Triples</I> where:</LI>

<OL type=a>
<LI>
the first item of <I>t<SUB>1</SUB></I> is RDF:PropName, the second item
is <I>n</I>, and the third item is the first item of <I>t</I>,</LI>

<LI>
the first item of <I>t<SUB>2</SUB></I> is RDF:PropObj, the second item
is <I>n</I>, and the third item is the second item of <I>t</I>,</LI>

<LI>
the first item of <I>t<SUB>3</SUB></I> is RDF:Value, the second item is
<I>n</I>, and the third item is the third item of <I>t</I>,</LI>

<LI>
the first item of <I>t<SUB>4</SUB></I> is RDF:InstanceOf, the second item
is <I>n</I>, and the third item is RDF:Property.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
To reify a property, all that is done is to add to the data model an additional
node and the four triples with first items (labeled arcs) of RDF:PropName,
RDF:PropObj, RDF:Value, and RDF:InstanceOf respectively, second item the
additional node, and third item the corresponding property type, resource
node, value node, and the RDF:Property node respectively. Note the difference
between the node RDF:Property and <I>properties</I>. RDF:Property is the
node defining a particular class of objects. The instances of that class
are the properties; i.e. triples.

<P>Frequently it is necessary to create a collection of nodes; for example
to state that a property has an ordered sequence of values. RDF defines
three kinds of collections: ordered lists of nodes, called <I>Sequences</I>,
unordered lists of nodes, called <I>Bags</I>, and lists that represent
alternatives for the (single) value of a property, called <I>Alternatives</I>.

<P>Formally, these three collection types are defined by:
<BR><A NAME="Seq"></A><A NAME="Bag"></A><A NAME="Alt"></A>
<TABLE BORDER >
<TR>
<TD>
<OL start=9>
<LI>
There are three elements of <I>Nodes</I>, not contained in <I>PropertyTypes</I>,
known as RDF:Seq, RDF:Bag, and RDF:Alt.</LI>

<LI>
There is a subset of <I>PropertyTypes</I> corresponding to the ordinals
(1, 2, 3, ...) called Ord. We refer to elements of Ord as RDF:1, RDF:2,
RDF:3, ...&nbsp;</LI>
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
To create a collection of nodes, create a new node with an RDF:InstanceOf
arc pointing to one of the three node types RDF:Seq, RDF:Bag, or RDF:Alt.
The remaining arcs from that new node point to each of the members of the
collection and are labeled using the elements from Ord. There may be at
most one arc from a single collection node labeled with each element of
Ord and the elements of Ord must be used in sequence starting with RDF:1.
For nodes that are instances of the RDF:Alt collection type, there must
be exactly one member whose arc label is RDF:1 and that is the default
value for the Alternatives node.
<H2>
<A NAME="transporting"></A>3. Transporting RDF</H2>
Descriptions may be associated with the resource they describe in one of
four ways:
<OL>
<LI>
The Description may be contained within the resource ("embedded"; e.g.
<A HREF="#embedHTML">in HTML</A>).</LI>

<LI>
The Description may be external to the resource but supplied by the transfer
mechanism in the same retrieval transaction as that which returns the resource
("along-with"; e.g. <A HREF="#viaHTTP">via HTTP</A>).</LI>

<LI>
The Description may be retrieved independently from the resource, including
from a different source ("service bureau"; e.g. <A HREF="#serviceBureau">using
HTTP</A>).</LI>

<LI>
The Description may contain the resource ("wrapped"; e.g. RDF itself).</LI>
</OL>
All resources will not support all association methods; in particular,
many kinds of resources will not support embedding and only certain kinds
of resources may be wrapped.

<P>A human- or machine-understandable description of an RDF schema may
be accessed through content negotiation by dereferencing the schema URI.
If the schema is machine-understandable it may be possible for an application
to learn some of the semantics of the property types named in the schema
on demand. The logic and syntax of RDF schemas are described in a separate
document; "RDF Machine Understandable Schemas" (in progress).

<P>This specification does not define any schemas; all references in this
document to specific schema URIs and associated property types are intended
as illustration only.
<H2>
<A NAME="grammar"></A>4. RDF Grammar</H2>
The RDF data model provides an abstract, conceptual framework for defining
and using metadata. A concrete syntax is also needed for the purposes of
authoring and exchanging this metadata. The syntax does not add to the
model; APIs may be provided to manipulate RDF without reference to a concrete
syntax. RDF uses the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">Extensible
Markup Language</A> [XML] encoding as its syntax. However, RDF will not
require (and conforming implementations must not require) an XML Document
Type Declaration for the contents of Descriptions. In this respect RDF
requires at most the XML <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-well-formed">well-formedness</A>
constraints. Schemas used by RDF Descriptions can be XML DTDs however other
schema languages are expected to be more common for use with RDF.

<P>The syntax descriptions below use the Extended Backus-Naur Form notation
as defined in <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-notation">section
6, Notation</A>, of [<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</A>] to
describe the essential RDF syntax elements. The EBNF here is condensed
for human readability; in particular, the italicized "<I><TT>rdf</TT></I>"
is used to represent a variable namespace name rather than the more precise
BNF notation "<TT>'&lt;' NSname ':...'</TT>" and the requirement that the
property and type names in end-tags exactly match the names in the corresponding
start-tags is implied by the XML rules. As RDF is written using XML, all
syntactic flexibilities of XML are also implicitly included; e.g. whitespace
rules, quoting using either single quote (') or double quote ("), <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-chardata">character
escaping</A>, case sensitivity, language tagging, etc. RDF requires the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119">XML namespace facility</A>,
currently under review by the XML Working Group, to associate the schema,
by way of its URI, with the properties in the Description.

<P>This specification defines two syntaxes for encoding an RDF data model
instance. The <I>serialization syntax</I> expresses the full capabilities
of the data model in a very regular fashion. The <I>abbreviated syntax</I>
includes additional constructs that provide a more compact form to represent
a subset of the data model. Conformant RDF interpreters are expected to
implement both the full serialization syntax and the abbreviated syntax.
<H3>
4.1 Serialization Syntax</H3>
RDF serialization syntax takes the form:
<PRE>&nbsp; [1] RDF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:RDF>' expression* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:RDF>'
&nbsp; [2] expression&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= description | collection<A NAME="Description"></A>
&nbsp; [3] description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? '>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; property* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Description>'
&nbsp; [4] collection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= sequence | bag | alternatives
&nbsp; [5] sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Seq' idAttr? '>' collMember* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Seq>'
&nbsp; [6] bag&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Bag' idAttr? '>' collMember* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Bag>
&nbsp; [7] alternatives&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Alt' idAttr? '>' collMember+ '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Alt>'
&nbsp; [8] collMember&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= hrefItem | valueItem
&nbsp; [9] hrefItem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:LI' hrefAttr '/>'
&nbsp;[10] valueItem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:LI>' value '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:LI>'
&nbsp;[11] idRefAttr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= idAttr | hrefAttr
&nbsp;[12] hrefAttr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '<I>rdf</I>:HREF="' resourceURI '"'
&nbsp;[13] idAttr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= 'ID="' IDsymbol '"'
&nbsp;[14] bagIdAttr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '<I>rdf</I>:BAGID="' IDsymbol '"'

The RDF element is a simple wrapper that marks the boundaries in an XML
document where the content is explicitly intended to be mappable into an
RDF data model instance.

<P>Description contains the remaining elements that cause the creation
of properties in the model instance. Each XML element <I>E</I> contained
by a Description results in the creation of a property (a triple that is
an element of the formal set <I>Triples</I>), where:
<OL>
<LI>
The first item (PropName) is the node that represents the resource whose
URI is the expansion of the namespace-qualified Generic Identifier (tag
name) of <I>E</I>.</LI>

<LI>
The second item (PropObj) is</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
the node that represents the resource whose URI is given by the value of
the HREF attribute of the Description or</LI>

<LI>
a new node representing a new resource whose identification is the value
of the ID attribute of the Description, if present; else the new resource
has no identification.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
If <I>E</I> is an empty element (no content), the third item (Value) is
the node that represents the resource whose URI is given by the HREF attribute
of <I>E</I>. If the content of <I>E</I> contains no XML markup, the Value
is the content of <I>E</I> (a string). Otherwise, the content of <I>E</I>
must be another Description or collection and the Value is the node named
by the (possibly implicit) ID or HREF of that Description or collection.</LI>
</OL>
The Description element itself creates an instance of a Bag node. The members
of this Bag are the nodes corresponding to the reification of each of the
properties in the Description. If the BAGID attribute is specified its
value is the identifier of this Bag, else the Bag is anonymous.

<P>When HREF is specified with Description, the properties in the Description
refer to the resource named in the HREF. A Description element without
an HREF attribute creates an in-line resource. Typically such a resource
will be a surrogate, or proxy, for some other real resource that does not
have a recognizable URI. This in-line resource has a URI formed using the
value of the ID attribute of the Description element, if present. When
another Description or property value refers to the in-line resource it
will use the value of the ID in an HREF attribute. When the other Description
refers to the bag of nodes corresponding to the reified properties it will
use the value of BAGID in an HREF attribute. Either ID or HREF may be specified
on Description but not both together in the same element. The values for
each ID and BAGID attribute must not appear more than once within a document
nor may the same value be used in an ID and a BAGID; that is, these two
attributes have <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-TokenizedType">XML
AttType ID</A>.

<P>Seq, Bag, and Alt create an instance of a sequence, bag, or alternatives
collection node type respectively. This node is the PropObj of an InstanceOf
property pointing to the corresponding collection node type. The members
of the collection are denoted by LI. Each XML element <I>E</I> contained
by an LI corresponds to one member of the collection and results in the
creation of a tuple where:
<OL>
<LI>
The first item (PropName) is assigned consecutively according to the (XML)
order of lexical appearance of each member starting with "RDF:1" for each
collection.</LI>

<LI>
The second item (PropObj) is a node <I>C</I> that represents the collection
created by the Seq, Bag, or Alt. The ID attribute, if specified, provides
the URI fragment identifier for <I>C</I>.</LI>

<LI>
(same as rule 3 above) If <I>E</I> is an empty element (no content), the
third item (Value) is the node that represents the resource whose URI is
given by the HREF attribute of <I>E</I>. If the content of <I>E</I> contains
no XML markup, the Value is content of <I>E</I> (a string). Otherwise,
the content of <I>E</I> must be another Description or collection and the
Value is the node named by the(possibly implicit) ID or HREF of that Description
or collection.</LI>
</OL>
The resourceURI identifies the target resource; i.e. the resource to which
the Description applies or the resource that is included in the collection.
The BAGID attribute on a Description element and the ID attribute on a
collection element permit that Description or collection to be referred
to by other Descriptions. The ID on a collection element also provides
the name that is used in an HREF attribute on a property element to make
the collection the value of that property.

<P>An RDF property takes the form:
<PRE>&nbsp;[17] property&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;' propName idAttr? '>' value '&lt;/' propName '>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | '&lt;' propName idRefAttr '/>'
&nbsp;[18] propName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '<I>rdf</I>:Value' | '<I>rdf</I>:InstanceOf' | name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | NSname ':' name
&nbsp;[19] value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= expression | string
&nbsp;[20] name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= (any legal XML name symbol)
&nbsp;[21] NSname&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= (any legal XML namespace prefix)
&nbsp;[22] string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= (any XML text, with "&lt;", ">", and "&amp;" escaped)</PRE>
Within <I>property</I>, the resourceURI used in an HREF attribute identifies
the resource that is the value of this property. The value of the ID attribute,
if specified, is the identifier for the node that represents the reification
of the property. If an expression is specified as a property value the
value is the node given by the HREF of the Description or the (possibly
implied) ID of the Description or collection. The propName Value may be
used for expressing non-binary relations; see example 5.3. <I><TT>String</TT></I>s
must be well-formed XML; the usual XML content quoting and escaping mechanisms
may be used if the string contains character sequences (e.g. "&lt;" and
"&amp;") that violate the well-formedness rules or that otherwise might
look like markup. The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag">xml:lang</A>
attribute may be used as defined by [<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</A>]
to associate a language with the property value. When used, xml:lang adds
no triples to the data model.

<P>It is recommended that property names always be qualified with a namespace
prefix to unambiguously connect the property definition with the corresponding
RDF schema.
<H3>
4.2 Abbreviated Syntax</H3>
The RDF abbreviated syntax can be employed for each property in a Description
where:
<OL>
<LI>
The given property name appears at most once in the Description and</LI>

<LI>
The property value is a string.</LI>
</OL>
The abbreviated syntax can also be employed for each property where:
<OL>
<LI>
The property value is a node and</LI>

<LI>
The values in any properties specified for that value node are strings.</LI>
</OL>
In addition, the abbreviated syntax provides a shorthand for specifying
a node with an InstanceOf property.

<P>The abbreviated syntax replaces productions [3] and [17] of the grammar
for the serialization syntax in the following manner:
<PRE>&nbsp; [3a] description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | '&lt;<I>rdf</I>:Description' idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; property* '&lt;/<I>rdf</I>:Description>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | typedNode
&nbsp;[17a] property&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;' propName idAttr? '>' value '&lt;/' propName '>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | '&lt;' propName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '/>'
&nbsp; [23] typedNode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= '&lt;' typeName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '/>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | '&lt;' typeName idRefAttr? bagIDAttr? propAttr* '>'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; property* '&lt;/' typeName '>'
&nbsp; [24] typeName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= NSname ':' name
&nbsp; [25] propAttr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= propName '="' string '"'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (with embedded quotes escaped)</PRE>
Each property type and value expressed in XML attribute form by productions
[3a] and [25] is equivalent to the same property type and value expressed
as XML content of the corresponding Description according to production
[17]. Specifically; each XML attribute <I>A</I> specified with a Description
start tag other than the attributes ID, HREF, or BAGID results in the creation
of a property (a triple), where:
<OL>
<LI>
The PropName (first item) is the node that represents the resource whose
URI is the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I>.</LI>

<LI>
The PropObj (second item) is the node that represents the resource whose
URI is given by the value of the HREF attribute or whose identifier is
given by the value of the ID attribute of the Description.</LI>

<LI>
The Value (third item) is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string).</LI>
</OL>
The typedNode form may be used to create or declare instances of nodes
of specific types and to further describe those nodes. A Description expressed
in typedNode form by production [23] is equivalent to the same Description
expressed by production [3a] with the same ID, BAGID, and HREF attributes
plus an additional InstanceOf property in the Description where the value
of the InstanceOf property is the fully expanded URI corresponding to the
typeName of the typedNode. Specifically, when a typedNode is given, each
XML attribute <I>A</I> other than ID, HREF, or BAGID and each property
<I>P</I> result in the creation of a triple where:
<OL>
<LI>
The first item (PropName) is the node that represents the resource whose
URI is the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I>
or the property name of <I>P</I>.</LI>

<LI>
The second item (PropObj) is the node <I>n</I> that represents the resource
whose URI is given by the value of the HREF attribute or whose identifier
is given by the value of the ID attribute of the typedNode element.</LI>

<LI>
The third item (Value) is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string) or
the value of <I>P</I>.</LI>
</OL>
plus an additional triple where the PropObj is the same node <I>n</I>,
the PropName is RDF:InstanceOf, and the Value is the node represented by
the typeName in the typedNode. If the typedNode is given as the value of
a property, the node <I>n</I> is the Value of that property in which the
typedNode was specified.

<P>Property types and values expressed in XML attribute form by productions
[17a] and [25] are equivalent to the same property types and values expressed
as XML content of a single Description element <I>D</I> and the resource
refered to by <I>D</I> is the value of the property named by the XML element
according to productions [19], [2], and [3]. Specifically; each property
start tag containing attribute specifications other than ID, HREF, or BAGID
results in the creation of a node <I>R</I> where <I>R</I> is the Value
of the property. If HREF is specified, <I>R</I> is the node corresponding
to the resource whose URI is the value of the attribute, else if ID is
specified <I>R</I> is a new node whose identifier is the value of the attribute,
otherwise <I>R</I> is anonymous. Each XML attribute <I>A</I> except ID,
HREF, and BAGID specified with that same property start tag results in
the creation of a property (a triple), where:
<OL>
<LI>
The PropObj is the node <I>R</I>.</LI>

<LI>
The PropName is the node that represents the resource whose URI is the
expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute name of <I>A</I>.</LI>

<LI>
The Value is the attribute value of <I>A</I> (a string).</LI>
</OL>
The value of the BAGID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the
Bag corresponding to the Description <I>D</I>; else the Bag is anonymous.
<H2>
<A NAME="signing"></A>5. Signed RDF</H2>
[[<I>This section to be completed</I>]]

<P>Descriptions may be <I>signed</I> to facilitate decisions that require
trust. Simple signatures include checksums or other Descriptions about
independently verifiable characteristics of a resource. The simplest example
of a signature is a statement that the associated Description applies only
to the version of the resource labeled with a given creation date. Stronger
signatures will include cryptographic measures to increase the likelihood
of detection of falsification of or inadvertent changes to the signed Description
or the resource(s) to which it applies.

6.1. Examples Using the RDF Core</H3>
With the core defined, we can construct and exchange directed graph models
of arbitrary complexity. We could begin by saying very simple things, such
as "John Smith is the Author of the document whose URL is http://www.bar.com/some.doc".
This description can be modeled with the directed graph:
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="graph.gif" ALT="simple node and arc diagram" HEIGHT=75 WIDTH=480>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax/graph.html">D</A></CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>Figure 1: directed graph diagram</CENTER>


<P>(We use a notation where nodes are represented as ellipses, arcs as
arrows, and atomic values &shy; i.e. strings &shy; are given in rectangles.)

<P>This small graph can be exchanged in the serialization syntax as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://docs.r.us.com/bibliography-info/" as="BIB"?>&nbsp;
&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#" as="RDF"?>&nbsp;
&lt;RDF:RDF>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description RDF:HREF="http://www.bar.com/some.doc">&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Author>John Smith&lt;/BIB:Author>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>&nbsp;
&lt;/RDF:RDF></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In most of the example figures the Bag corresponding to the reified properties
in each Description will be omitted from the graph to improve readability.
To illustrate the complete graph, consider the following example:
<UL>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://docs.r.us.com/bibliography-info/" as="BIB"?>&nbsp;
&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#" as="RDF"?>&nbsp;
&lt;RDF:RDF>
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description RDF:HREF="http://www.bar.com/some.doc" RDF:BAGID="D_001">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Author>John Smith&lt;/BIB:Author>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Title>How to install IXI 3.4&lt;/BIB:Title>
&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>
&lt;/RDF:RDF></PRE>
</UL>
As shown in Figure 2, the Description itself becomes a Bag node where the
contents of the collection list the individual properties that were part
of that particular Description.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="bag.gif" ALT="expansion of a Description as a Bag" >
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax/bag.html">D</A></CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>Figure 2: Descriptions create Bag nodes</CENTER>


<P>Note that the Description uses the HREF attribute to say that the properties
refer to the existing node whose URI is "http://www.bar.com/some.doc".

<P>We could create a more elaborate model in order to say additional things
about John Smith, such as his contact information. We might construct the
model:
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="structure.gif" ALT="A property value that is a node" HEIGHT=247 WIDTH=432>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax/structure.html">D</A></CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>Figure 3: Structured property value (Bag omitted)</CENTER>


<P>which could be exchanged using the RDF serialization representation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://docs.r.us.com/bibliography-info/" as="BIB"?>&nbsp;
&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#" as="RDF"?>&nbsp;
&lt;RDF:RDF>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description RDF:HREF="http://www.bar.com/some.doc">&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Author>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Name>John Smith&lt;/BIB:Name>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Email>john@smith.com&lt;/BIB:Email>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Phone>+1 (555) 123-4567&lt;/BIB:Phone>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/BIB:Author>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>&nbsp;
&lt;/RDF:RDF></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note here that the Description that is the value of the Author property
does not have an HREF attribute. Therefore, this Description creates a
new (unnamed) node and this new node is the property value of the Author
property.

<P>The serialization above provides the same properties as this second
serialization, with an ID specified for the anonymous resource:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://docs.r.us.com/bibliography-info/" as="BIB"?>&nbsp;
&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#" as="RDF"?>&nbsp;
&lt;RDF:RDF>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description RDF:HREF="http://www.bar.com/some.doc">&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Author RDF:HREF="#John_Smith"/>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &lt;RDF:Description ID="John_Smith">&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Name>John Smith&lt;/BIB:Name>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Email>john@smith.com&lt;/BIB:Email>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BIB:Phone>+1 (555) 123-4567&lt;/BIB:Phone>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;/RDF:Description>
&lt;/RDF:RDF></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As an example of making a statement about a statement, consider the case
of wanting to indicate when a particular description was written and who
wrote the description.

<P>What we want to say in the model is expressed by this pair of graphs;
that we have an XML encoding of some description, and that there is some
other XML content that makes further statements about that encoding. If
we look into the details, the graph is really as shown in Figure 5.

Observe that the CreatedOn and CreatedBy properties refer not to "http://www.bar.com/some.doc"
but rather to the statement "John Smith is the creator of http://www.bar.com/some.doc".
That statement was, according to this graph, made by Jane Cooper.

<P>Also note that node labels such as "RDF:Property" are shorthand for
a full URI such as "http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#Property".

6.3. Using Binary Relations to Represent Relations of Higher Arity</H3>
The RDF data model intrinsically only supports binary relations. However,
in this section we show how we can represent higher arity relations using
just binary relations. As an example, consider the subject of one of John
Smith's recent articles - library science. We could use the Dewey Decimal
Code for library science to categorize that article. Dewey Decimal codes
are far from the only subject categorization scheme. So we might want to
define a "Subject" node that not only told us the subject of a paper but
also indicated the categorization scheme it came from. That might look
like:

A common use of this higher-arity capability is when dealing with units
of measure. A person's weight is not just a number like 94, it also requires
us to specify the unit of measure used. In this case we might be using
either pounds or kilograms. We could use a relationship with an additional
arc to record the fact that John Smith is a rather strapping gentleman:

<H2>
<A NAME="namespaces"></A>Appendix A: Brief Explanation of XML Namespaces</H2>
This material is non-normative, but believed necessary for an understanding
of the RDF serialization syntax. It will be replaced by references to the
appropriate sections of [<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</A>]
once they have been published. The material here is our best understanding
of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119">namespace
proposal</A>, but may differ from what the final outcome will be.

<P>The XML Working Group is currently developing a facility that will allow
(at least) Generic Identifiers (tag names) to have a prefix which will
make them unique and will prevent name clashes when developing documents
that mix elements from different schemas. This facility allows a document's
prolog to contain a set of Processing Instructions (PIs) of the form:
<UL>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="some-uri" as="some-abbreviation"?></PRE>
</UL>
for example
<UL>
<PRE>&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#" as="RDF"?>
&lt;?xml:namespace name="http://www.purl.org/metadata/dublin_core#" as="DC"?></PRE>
</UL>
Elements in the document may then use generic identifiers of the form &lt;RDF:Description>
or &lt;DC:Title>. Those element names would expand to URIs such as http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#Description.
<H2>
<A NAME="usage"></A>Appendix B: Notes about Usage</H2>

<H3>
B.1. Property Names</H3>
The RDF serialization and abbreviated syntaxes use XML as their encoding.
XML elements and attributes are case sensitive, so RDF property names are
therefore also case sensitive. This specification does not require any
specific format for property names other than that they be legal XML <I><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-name">names</A></I>.
For its own identifiers, RDF has adopted the convention that all property
names use "InterCap style"; that is, the first letter of the property name
is capitalized and the remainder is lowercase; e.g. <I>Value</I>. When
the property name is a composition of words or fragments of words, the
words are concatenated with the first letter of each word capitalized and
no additional punctutation; e.g. <I>PropName</I>.
<H3>
B.2. Namespace URIs</H3>
RDF uses the proposed XML namespace mechanism to implement globally unique
identifiers for all properties. In addition, the namespace URI serves as
the URI of the corresponding RDF schema. An RDF processor can expect to
use the schema URI to access the schema content. This specification places
no further requirements on the content that might be supplied at that URI,
nor how (if at all) the URI might be modified to obtain alternate forms
or a fragment of the schema.
<H3>
<A NAME="embedHTML"></A>B.3. Embedding in HTML</H3>
The recommended technique for embedding RDF expressions in an HTML document
is simply to insert the RDF in-line. This will make the resulting document
non-conformant to HTML specifications up to and including HTML 4.0 but
the RDF Working Group hopes that the HTML specification will evolve to
support this. Two practical issues will arise when this technique is employed
with respect to browsers conforming to specifications of HTML up to and
including HTML 4.0. Alternatives are available to authors in these cases;
it is up to the author to choose the appropriate alternative in each circumstance.
<OL>
<LI>
Some HTML 2.0 browsers will assume a &lt;/HEAD> tag immediately before
the first RDF element that appears within &lt;HEAD>.</LI>


<P>Authors concerned about very old browsers may place all RDF expressions
at the end of the document head.
<LI>
All HTML browsers conforming to specifications up to and including HTML
4.0 will render any content appearing in RDF property values expressed
as XML element types (i.e. production [17]).</LI>


<P>Authors concerned about preventing their RDF content from rendering
in old browsers may use the abbreviated syntax to move the property value
into an attribute. Not all properties can be expressed this way.</OL>
In the event that none of the alternatives above provides the capabilities
desired by the author, the RDF expressions may be left external to the
HTML document and linked with an HTML &lt;LINK> element. The recommended
relation type for this purpose is REL="meta"; e.g.
<UL>
<PRE>&lt;link rel="meta" href="mydocMetadata"></PRE>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="viaHTTP"></A>B.4 Transporting in HTTP Headers</H3>
We specify a simple extension to HTTP that allows a client to request that
RDF metadata be included in a header along with the document. We deal here
only with the HTTP protocol; we hope that other protocols will be similarly
extended.

<P>[[<I>This section to be completed.</I>]]
<H3>
<A NAME="serviceBureau"></A>B.5 Requesting Metadata via HTTP</H3>
RDF metadata can also be retrieved separately from the resource(s) to which
it refers. To request metadata in this way, a client contacts a metadata
service bureau. A service bureau is an HTTP server that understands a particular
query syntax. It can provide metadata for documents that reside on other
servers as well as for documents available through protocols other than
HTTP.

<P>[[<I>This section to be completed.</I>]]
<H2>
<A NAME="openIssues"></A>Appendix C: Open Issues</H2>

<H3>
C.1. Resource Scope</H3>
Should RDF introduce a way for an HREF to refer to a collection of resources
which cannot be enumerated in any simple way (for example, by providing
a URI "prefix" and indicating that the target is the collection of URIs
with that prefix). The mechanism could also provide ways of restricting
the set of URIs selected (e.g., only certain media types would qualify).
<H3>
C.2. Mandatory Extensions</H3>
In PICS, there is a need for specifying that if a processing agent does
not understand the semantics of a certain property the entire "label" should
be discarded. The question for the RDF specification is whether it is sufficient
to say that this is a problem which needs to be addressed by those designing
a PICS schema for RDF, or whether a mechanism like this should be part
of the core RDF.
<H3>
C.6. Canonicalization of Models</H3>
Section 2 makes reference to testing the equivalence of RDF expressions.
We need a definition of a canonical form for an instance of an RDF data
model to permit comparison of two such instances. This canonical form will
likely be produced by eliminating triples that represent reified properties
but that are not used elsewhere in the model.
<H3>
C.7. Support for schemes (ala Dublin Core)</H3>
This issue is deferred pending input from Dublin Core community and further
experience with the use of namespaces

<P><I>Scheme</I> is a term used in the Dublin Core community to denote
the specific controlled vocabulary from which a Value has been chosen.
Examples of vocabularies covered by schemes include units of measure, library
subject heading codes, and Dewey Decimal numbers. This same facility might
also be used to denote a particular encoding format; e.g. date in ISO 8601
form, or name in "family, given" form. We recognize that this mechanism
will be common to many RDF applications and it seems appropriate to indicate
a recommended practice in the core specification.
<H3>
C.10. Interactions between XML Markup Declarations and RDF</H3>
We have noticed in the description discussion that there are features of
XML -- such as XLL (XML-link) -- that may have unanticipated side- effects
on the intended RDF semantics. In particular, markup declarations in the
document prolog may cause the XML parser to alter the interpretation of
an RDF element. We need to evaluate the impact of such processing, especially
in the context of digitally signed RDF descriptions.
<H3>
C.20. Namespace defaulting</H3>
This issue is deferred pending a decision on XML namespaces by the XML
Working Group

<P>Should RDF specify the method for determining a namespace when a namespace
qualifier is omitted?
<H3>
C.21. Distributive referents</H3>
A concise mechanism is desired to state properties that apply to each element
of a collection rather than to the collection as a whole.
<H3>
C.22. How to compute the property type URI</H3>
This issue is deferred pending a decision on XML namespaces by the XML
Working Group

<P>The XML namespace proposal does not specify how the namespace URI is
to be combined with a qualified element name to produce a URI for the element
description. RDF would like to be able to compute a URI to access the RDF
Schema definition of a particular property type.

<P>&nbsp;
<H3>
C.23. Language tagging of substrings</H3>
This issue will be deferred until after the 1.0 specification.

<P>A property value may need to be a string tagged in multiple languages;
how do we accomplish this?
<H3>
C.24. Requesting Metadata via HTTP</H3>
We need to specify how a client can request RDF metadata separately from
the resource to which the metadata refers. This protocol is necessary to
enable metadata service bureaus.
<H3>
C.25. Transporting in HTTP Headers</H3>
We need to specify how RDF metadata will be transported in an HTTP header
so that a client can request metadata along with the resource when it is
infeasible or inappropriate to embed the metadata inside the resource.
