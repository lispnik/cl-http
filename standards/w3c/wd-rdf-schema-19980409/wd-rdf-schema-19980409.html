Status of this document</H2>
This draft document is a work in progress. It represents the deliberations
of the W3C RDF Schema Working Group as of the date it was issued. The Working
Group has not reached full consensus on all parts of this draft and is
continuing to refine this document; we are issuing this document to solicit
comments on our progress. We especially call the reader's attention to
Appendix C ("Open Issues").

<P>The Resource Description Framework is part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Metadata/">W3C
Metadata Activity</A>. The goal of this activity, and of RDF specifically,
is to produce a language for the exchange of machine-understandable descriptions
of resources on the Web. A separate specification describes the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax">data
model and syntax</A> for the interchange of metadata using RDF.

<P>Comments may be sent to <A HREF="mailto:www-rdf-comments@w3.org">www-rdf-comments@w3.org</A>.
The public archive of these comments is available at <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/</A>

<P><B>We strongly recommend that only experimental software be implemented
to this document. It is our belief that this document does not sufficiently
constrain implementations to guarantee interoperability. This Working Group
will not allow early implementations to affect their ability to make substantial
changes to future versions of this document.</B>

<P>This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by
other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts
as reference material or to cite them as other than "work in progress".

<P><B>Note:</B> As working drafts are subject to frequent change, you are
advised to reference the above URL for "Latest version" rather than the
URLs for working draft versions themselves. The latest version URL will
always point to the most current version of this draft.

RDF Schemas</H2>

<H3>
1. Motivation and Scope</H3>
The model described by this document uses RDF concepts to provide a basic
schema for RDF.

<P>An RDF schema is a collection of information about classes of RDF nodes,
including properties and relations. This paper supplements the RDF Model
and Syntax [<A HREF="#refs">RDFMS</A>] specification by providing a typing
system: informally, it is a basic set of nodes and relations that can be
used to express properties of classes of RDF nodes. It includes a facility
to indicate that certain classes are subclasses of others, and provides
a small number of basic classes. Finally, it contains a facility for specifying
a small number of constraints such as the cardinality (number of occurences)
required and permitted of properties of instances of classes.

<P>This document does not define classes applying to specific application
domains. For example, it does not define classes such as "Author" or "DigitalSignature."
Instead, it provides a mechanism that can be used to define characteristics
of such classes.

<P>RDF schemas are specified using a declarative representation language
influenced by ideas from knowledge representation, e.g., semantic nets,
frames, and predicate logic, as well as database schema representation
models such as binary relational models ([<A HREF="#refs">NIAM</A>], etc.)
and graph data models. The RDF schema specification language is less expressive,
but simpler, than full predicate calculus languages such as CycL [<A HREF="#refs">CycL</A>]
and KIF [<A HREF="#refs">KIF</A>].
<H4>
1.1 The Scope</H4>
RDF Schemas aim, not at theoretical issues, but at solving a small number
of immediate problems. Its creators expect that other problems (listed
in the appendix) will share similar characteristics and that they also
may be able to use the basic classes described in this paper.

<P>This paper was directly influenced by consideration of the following
problems:
<DL>
<DT>
1. <B>PICS</B></DT>


<P>The RDF Model and Syntax is adequate to represent most of PICS [<A HREF="#refs">PICS</A>],
however, it requires augmentation by features such as the ability to specify
a default rating for any page with a certain URL prefix. This draft does
not yet provide such a mechanism.
<DT>
2. <B>Simple Web Metadata</B></DT>


<P>One obvious application for RDF is in the description of web pages.
This is one of the basic functions of the Dublin Core [<A HREF="#refs">DC</A>]
initiative. The Dublin Core is a set of 15 elements believed to be broadly
applicable to describing web resources to enable their discovery. The Dublin
Core has been a major influence on the development of RDF. An important
consideration in the development of the Dublin Core was to allow simple
descriptions, but also to provide the ability to qualify descriptions in
order to provide both domain specific elaboration and descriptive precision.

<P>The RDF Schema mechanism proposed in this paper provides a machine-understandable
system for defining 'schemas' for descriptive vocabularies like the Dublin
Core. It allows designers to specify classes of Resource types, property
types to convey descriptions of those classes, and constraints on the allowed
combinations of classes, property types, and values.

<P>An initial schema for the simple Dublin Core is provided in Appendix
D. This schema defines the 15 elements as property types, and gives a description
of their purpose. Despite the simplicity of the definition, it is believed
that this schema serves as the foundation for more elaborate definitions.
Future extensions are likely to specify the structure of the values of
the properties, which will involve defining classes, the property types
that apply to those classes, and some constraints on the property values.
In order for browsers and authoring tools to understand and enforce these
constraints, this information should be machine understandable. This document
provides a machine understandable schema language for expressing such definitions
and constraints.
<DT>
3. <B>Sitemaps and other such Navigation Tools</B></DT>


<P>A sitemap is some kind of hierarchical description of a site. A subject
taxonomy is a taxonomy such as that used by Yahoo!, Excite, etc. RDF Schemas
aims to provide a mechanism by which sitemaps and taxonomies using the
RDF Model can express the classes of nodes, properties, relations etc.
they use.
<DT>
4. <B>P3P</B></DT>


<P>The W3C Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) requires a grammar
for constructing statements about a site's data collection practices, personal
preferences as exercised over those practices, as well as a syntax for
exchanging structured data. The ability for third party assurances (signed
statements) regarding P3P practices is also important. For instance, entities
may wish to certify that P3P practice statements were properly generated
in accordance with industry guidelines, have been audited, or are compliant
with the relevant privacy regulations.</DL>
These problems have influenced the design of this first version of the
RDF Schema. RDF is tailored for easy extensibility. If RDF succeeds, we
expect that future versions of RDF will be more ambitious and include more
problems in their design space.
<H4>
1.2 Specifying the Schema</H4>
An RDF Schema can be expressed by the data model described in the RDF Model
and Syntax [<A HREF="#refs">RDFMS</A>] document. The schema description
language is simply a set of resources and property types defined by this
paper and implicitly part of every RDF graph using this schema machinery.

<P>For this release of the document, we have concentrated on identifying
the set of RDF resources and property types and their relationships. We
especially solicit comment on the understandability of the names we have
chosen for these.
<H3>
2. The RDF Schema Core</H3>
The following resources belong to the Core RDF Schema. We first define
the type system and then introduce property types for expressing various
kinds of constraints.
<H4>
2.1 The Type System</H4>
The RDF Schema defined in this paper is a set of RDF resources and property
types that can be used to describe classes of RDF nodes, including properties
and relations. They are defined in a namespace informally called 'RDFS'
here and which will be more formally defined and given a URI in the future.

<P>As described in the RDF Model and Syntax paper, nodes may be RDF:instanceOf
one or more classes. However, classes themselves are often used in a hierarchical
fashion, for example considering the class 'dog' to be a subclass of 'animal,'
which is a subclass of 'organism' etc., meaning that any node which is
an RDF:instanceOf 'dog' is <I>ipso facto</I> an RDF:instanceOf 'animal'
and so on. This paper describes a property type, RDFS:subClassOf, indicating
such a relationship.

<P>In addition to describing the RDFS:subClassOf relation between classes,
this paper defines a small number of other resources and properties that
express constraints on instances of classes, such things as statements
that all instances of a class have certain properties or relations, limitations
on the types of values that are valid for a property or relation, as well
as the cardinality of those properties and relations. This paper gives
a mechanism for describing such constraints, but does not say whether or
how an application must process the constraint information. For example,
while an RDF schema may express that a 'Book' may have an 'author' property,
it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing
that information. We expect that different applications will use these
constraints in different ways. e.g., a validator will look for errors,
an editor might suggest legal values.

<P>We anticipate the development of a set of classes corresponding to a
set of "datatypes." This paper does not define datatypes, but does note
that datatypes may be used as the value of the RDFS:range property.
<H4>
2.2 Core Classes</H4>
The following resources are core classes that are defined as part of the
RDF Schema machinery. Every RDF graph (implicitly) includes these.

<P><I>2.2.1 RDF:Resource</I>
<BR>All resources, i.e., all the elements of the set N defined in section
2.1 of the RDF Model and Syntax document, are instances of RDF:Resource.
This roughly corresponds to the concept of <I>Object</I> in Java.

<P><I>2.2.2 RDF:PropertyType</I>
<BR>All the property types, i.e., all the elements of the set P defined
in section 2.1 of the RDF Model and Syntax document, are instances of RDF:PropertyType.
Conversely, every instance of RDF:PropertyType is an element of P.

<P><I>2.2.3 RDFS:Class</I>
<BR>This corresponds to the generic concept of a <I>Type</I> or <I>Category</I>.
When a schema defines a new class, the node representing that class must
have an RDF:instanceOf arc to this node. Classes can be defined to represent
almost anything, such as web pages, people, cars, rabbits, and animals.
<H4>
2.3 Core PropertyTypes</H4>
Every RDF graph also (implicitly) includes the following core property
types. These are instances of the <I>PropertyType</I> class and provide
a mechanism for expressing relationships between classes and their instances
or superclasses.

<P><I>2.3.1 RDF:instanceOf</I>
<BR>This indicates that a resource is a member of a class, and thus has
all the characteristics that are to be expected of a member of that class.
It is a relation between a resource and another resource which must be
an instance of <I>Class</I>. A resource may be an instance of more than
one class.

<P><I>2.2.2 RDFS:subClassOf</I>
<BR>This indicates the subset/superset relation between classes. <I>RDFS:subClassOf</I>
is transitive. If B is a sub-class of A and X is an instance of B, then
X is also an instance of A. Only instances of <I>Class</I> can have this
property type and the property value is always an <I>instanceOf</I> <I>Class</I>.
A <I>Class</I> may be a <I>subClassOf</I> more than one <I>Class</I>.
<H2>
3. Constraints</H2>
An RDF schema can declare constraints associated with classes and property
types. Some examples of constraints include:
<OL>
<LI>
That the value of a property should be a resource of a designated class.
This is expressed by the <I>range</I> property type. For example, a range
constraint applying to the 'author' property type may express that the
value of an 'author' property must be a resource of class 'Person'.</LI>

<LI>
That the resource may have properties of a given property type. For example,
that a resource of class 'Book' may have a property of type 'author'. This
is expressed using the <I>allowedPropertyType</I> property type. This constraint
allows one -- in effect -- to implement domain-constraints for property
types.</LI>

<LI>
The cardinality of a property type, that is, the number of properties of
a given type that a resource may have. This is described by the <I>necessity</I>
property type. For example, it may express that any given resource may
have at most one property of type 'age'.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
3.1 Core Constraints</H4>
<I>3.1.1 RDFS:ConstraintPropertyType</I>
<BR>This resource defines a subclass of the PropertyTypes, all of whose
instances are property types used to specify constraints. The rest of the
property types defined in section 3 are instances of this class.

<P><I>3.1.2 RDFS:range</I>
<BR>An instance of <I>ConstraintPropertyType</I> that is used to constrain
property values. The value of a <I>range</I> property is always a <I>Class</I>.
The property value of a property type whose range is A is constrained to
be an instanceOf A. A property type can have at most one <I>range</I> property.
It is possible for it to have <I>no</I> range, in which case, the property
value could be anything.

<P><I>3.1.3 RDFS:allowedPropertyType</I>
<BR>An instance of <I>ConstraintPropertyType</I> that is used to specify
the properties that the instances of a Class may have.

<P><I>3.1.4 RDFS:necessity</I>
<BR>An instance of <I>ConstraintPropertyType</I> that is used to constrain
the cardinality of a property type. <I>RDFS:necessity</I> has a range of
<I>RDFS:NecessityValue</I> (defined below).
<H4>
3.2 Cardinality Constraints</H4>
The property <I>necessity</I> is used to specify whether a certain property
type is
<UL>
<LI>
<I>3.2.1</I> Necessary and may occur only once : <I>RDFS:ExactlyOne</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.2.2</I> Necessary and may occur any number of times : <I>RDFS:OneOrMore</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.2.3</I> Optional and may occur at most once : <I>RDFS:ZeroOrOne</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.2.4</I> Optional and may occur any number of times : <I>RDFS:ZeroOrMore</I></LI>
</UL>
<I>3.2.5 RDFS:NecessityValue</I>
<BR>RDFS:ExactlyOne, RDFS:OneOrMore, RDFS:ZeroOrOne and RDFS:ZeroOrMore
are all instances of the class RDFS:NecessityValue.
<H4>
3.3 Miscellaneous</H4>
<I>3.3.1 RDFS:comment</I>
<BR>This is used to provide a human readable natural language description
of a resource.

<P>The Model and Syntax specification introduces certain concepts. Here
we define resources corresponding to these concepts.
<UL>
<LI>
<I>3.3.2 RDFS:Collection</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.3.3 RDF:Bag</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.3.4 RDF:Seq</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>3.3.5 RDF:Alt</I></LI>
</UL>
<I>3.3.6: RDFS:String</I>
<BR>This corresponds to the definition of a String in the Model and Syntax
document [<A HREF="#refs">RDFMS</A>].
<H2>
4. Figures</H2>
<B>Figure 1</B> illustrates the concepts of Class, subClass, and Resource.
A Class is depicted by a rounded rectangle, a Resource is depicted by a
large dot. In the figure below, arrows are drawn from a Resource to the
Class it defines. A subClass is shown by having a rounded rectangle (the
subclass) completely enclosed by another (the superclass). If a Resource
is inside a Class, then there exists either an explicit or implicit "RDF:instanceOf"
arc from the Resource to the Resource that defines the Class. (Those arcs
are shown in figure 2).
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sets.gif" ALT="Figure 1: Classes and Resources as Sets and Elements" ></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Figure 1</B>: Classes and Resources as Sets and Elements</CENTER>


<P><B>Figure 2</B> shows the same information about the class hierarchy
as in figure 1, but does so in terms of the RDF data model. If a class
is a subset of another, then there is a RDFS:subClassOf arc from the node
representing the first class to the node representing the second. Similarly,
if a Resource was an instance of a Class, then there is an RDF:instanceOf
arc from the resource to the node representing the class. (Not all such
arcs are shown. We only show the arc to the most tightly encompassing class,
and rely on the transitivity of the 'subClassOf' relation to provide the
rest).

own PropertyTypes can be used. These constraints are shown below in <B>figure
3</B>.

<H2>
Appendix C: Open Issues</H2>
The following issues are currently under consideration by the RDF Schema
working group, and will be covered in more detail in a future version of
this document.
<BR><A NAME="c1"></A>
<H3>
C.3. Alternatives for expressing cardinality</H3>
The number of distinct properties of a particular type that a resource
has is defined by "Cardinality". There are a number of possible alternative
mechanisms for expressing cardinality (e.g. a fixed, minimum, or maximum
number, etc). While it is agreed that the expression of cardinality is
necessary, the specifics of this expression are still being discussed.
Currently, the RDF schema group is reviewing cardinality constraints that
are expressed in both the Unified Modelling Language [<A HREF="#refs">UML</A>]
and the XML-Data note [<A HREF="#refs">XML-Data</A>].
<BR><A NAME="c8"></A>
<H3>
C.8. Versioning</H3>
The Resource Description Framework is intended to be flexible and easily
extensible; this suggests that a great variety of schemas will be created
and that new and improved versions of these schemas will be a common occurence
on the Web. Since changing a schema risks breaking other RDF graphs which
depend on that schema, this specification requires that a new URI is used
whenever an RDF schema is changed. In effect, changing a schema creates
a new one; new schemas should have their own URI to avoid ambiguity. Since
an RDF Schema URI unambiguously identifies a single version of a schema,
RDF processors (and Web caches) should be able to safely store copies of
RDF schema graphs for an indefinite period.

<P>The problems of RDF schema evolution share many characteristics with
XML DTD version management and the general problem of Web resource versioning.
Is is expected that a general approach to these issues will presented in
a future version of this document, in co-ordination with other W3C activities.
Future versions of this document may also offer RDF specific guidelines:
for example, describing how a schema could document its relationship to
preceding versions.
<BR><A NAME="c9"></A>
<H3>
C.9. Thesauri and large schemas</H3>
Thesauri are a well known example of hierarchical systems for representing
the relationships between concepts. The RDF Schema specification provides
sufficient resources for creating machine readable representations of thesauri
(and other faceted classification systems). Some practical issue for deploying
these large schemas are yet to be resolved.

<P>In particular: should it be possible to avoid requiring RDF aware user-agents
to download the entire large schema across the network when dereferencing
a schema URI? In particular: how, if it all, might a schema namespace URI
be modified to obtain alternate forms or fragments of the schema? (one
possible scenario being the use of the XML-Link [<A HREF="#refs">XML-Link</A>]
'|' fragment identifier).
<BR><A NAME="c11"></A>
<H3>
C.11. What does a schema look like on the Web?</H3>
The RDF Schema group is currently discussing the actual representation
of a schema. XML namespace mechanisms provide the ability to point to RDF
Schemas. What exactly will they be pointing at? Is a RDF Schema a single
document with both HTML, for human readability, and an embedded instance
of RDF for machine processability? Are there multiple documents? Are there
both human-readable and machine-processable portions of RDF that are handled
through content negotiation?
<BR><A NAME="c12"></A>
<H3>
C.12. Class Sealing</H3>

<DIV CLASS="PUBLIC">We would like to define a mechanism for 'sealing' an
RDF Class, so that it becomes illegal to make certain RDF statements involving
it. This is loosely analogous to the notion of 'final' classes in Java
/ OO programming. We might, for example, want to stop people creating subclasses
of the class, or creating property types which have that class as their
domain. The degree of sophistication required of the class sealing mechanism
is as yet unclear: we might (for example) wish to consider the feasibility
of using digital signatures in this context.</DIV>

<H3>
C.19. Property Value Inheritance</H3>
In order to represent the PICS generic concept, RDF Schemas need to be
able to specify inheritance of property values.
<BR><A NAME="c21"></A>
<H3>
C.21. Interactions with External Type Systems</H3>
The RDF Schema mechanism defines a basic type system. It was not developed
to provide every imaginable capability. Instead, in the interests of simplicity
and performance, it will be only as expressive as needed to meet the requirements
of PICS. (Support for PICS <I>generic</I> capability, which we expect to
be in the next public release of this document, will provide enough sophistication
for most applications).

<P>The RDF Schema mechanism will need to interact with many externally
developed typing systems. There are two broad categories of such systems.
The first are externally defined "primitive data types", such as IEEE floating
point numbers, Integers, Boolean values, Dates and Times, etc. The second
category are external "type systems", which provide features such as inheritance,
type inferencing, etc.

<P>At this time we have not even begun to consider the second category.
Several factors make it difficult to decide on the appropriate interactions
with the first category. RDF models are exchanged as XML document instances.
The XML Working group has expressed an interest in working on the problem
of data typing, to provide the ability to specify that element content
should be interpreted as an integer, a date, a float, left as a string,
etc. The interactions between data typing efforts in XML and RDF is currently
being discussed by the W3 staff, so this document does not provide a specification
for those interactions that is as firm as the specification for elements
such as RDFS:Class, RDFS:subClassOf, etc.

<P>However, it is the rough consensus of the RDF Schema WG that it would
be useful to show that the current schema system can actually accommodate
externally defined primitive data types. Therefore, figure 1, and the relevant
portion of the text of the specification, was modified to give a provisional
indication of how external types might be handled. The reader is advised
that those portions of the specification are highly subject to change,
even more so than the rest of this specification. All of those sections
have been explicitly marked to refer to this open issue.
<BR><A NAME="c22"></A>
<H3>
C.22. RDFS:String</H3>
The treatment of RDFS:String is still under discussion by the working group,
and there is a known inconsistency in the definitions in Appendix A. The
range of RDFS:range is RDFS:Class, RDFS:String is intended to be used as
the value of RDFS:range properties, but RDFS:String is not a Class. This
will be corrected, and the status of RDFS:String will be clarified, in
a later version of this document.
<BR><A NAME="c23"></A>
<H3>
C.23. Context-specific constraints</H3>
In the current draft, constraints on property types (range and necessity)
apply across all uses of the property type. Some user communities have
expressed an interest in the ability to further constrain a property type
in the context a particular class. For example, instances of Animal may
have the property biologicalParent. The range of biologicalParent is Animal,
i.e., the values of biologicalParent properties are instances of Animal.
If we could further constrain the range of a property type in the context
of a particular Class, we could express a further constraint that the range
of biologicalParent in the context of Person is Person, i.e., the value
of biologicalParent properties for Person has to be a Person. Feedback
on this issue is solicited.
<BR><A NAME="c24"></A>
<H3>
C.24. Interactions between subclassing and constraints</H3>
We believe that there are important interactions between subclassing and
at least some constraints, but we do not specify these interactions.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Appendix D: Dublin Core</H2>
The following represents an initial schema for the simple Dublin Core Element
Set [<A HREF="#refs">DC</A>].

<P>This schema is provided as the foundation for the Dublin Core semantics.
It is believed to be all that is needed to serve as the foundation for
future, more elaborate definitions. Future extensions are likely to specify
the structure of the values of the properties, which will involve defining
classes, the property types that apply to those classes, and some constraints
on the property values.

&nbsp; element may contain a date, creator, format, identifier, or other
&nbsp; metadata for the second resource when it is considered important for
&nbsp; discovery of the present resource; recommended best practice is to
&nbsp; use the Relation element instead.&nbsp; For example, it is possible to
&nbsp; use a Source date of 1603 in a description of a 1996 film adaptation
&nbsp; of a Shakespearean play, but it is preferred instead to use Relation
&nbsp; "IsBasedOn" with a reference to a separate resource whose
&nbsp; description contains a Date of 1603. Source is not applicable if the
&nbsp; present resource is in its original form.&lt;/RDFS:Comment>

&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:Comment>The language of the intellectual content of the
&nbsp; resource. Where practical, the content of this field should coincide
&nbsp; with RFC 1766 [Tags for the Identification of Languages,
&nbsp; http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt ]; examples include en, de,
&nbsp; es, fi, fr, ja, th, and zh.&lt;/RDFS:Comment>

&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:necessity RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:Comment>An identifier of a second resource and its
&nbsp; relationship to the present resource. This element permits links
&nbsp; between related resources and resource descriptions to be
&nbsp; indicated. Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf), a
&nbsp; translation of a work (IsBasedOn), a chapter of a book (IsPartOf),
&nbsp; and a mechanical transformation of a dataset into an image
&nbsp; (IsFormatOf). For the sake of interoperability, relationships should
&nbsp; be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under
&nbsp; development in the workshop series.&lt;/RDFS:Comment>

&lt;RDF:Description ID = "Coverage">
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:instanceOf RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Syntax#PropertyType"/>
&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:necessity RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:Comment>The spatial or temporal characteristics of the
&nbsp; intellectual content of the resource. Spatial coverage refers to a
&nbsp; physical region (e.g., celestial sector); use coordinates (e.g.,
&nbsp; longitude and latitude) or place names that are from a controlled
&nbsp; list or are fully spelled out. Temporal coverage refers to what the
&nbsp; resource is about rather than when it was created or made available
&nbsp; (the latter belonging in the Date element); use the same date/time
&nbsp; format (often a range) [Date and Time Formats (based on ISO8601),
&nbsp; W3C Technical Note, http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime] as
&nbsp; recommended for the Date element or time periods that are from a
&nbsp; controlled list or are fully spelled out.&lt;/RDFS:Comment>
&lt;/RDF:Description>

&lt;RDF:Description ID = "Rights">
&nbsp; &lt;RDF:instanceOf RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Syntax#PropertyType"/>
&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:necessity RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
&nbsp; &lt;RDFS:Comment>A rights management statement, an identifier that
&nbsp; links to a rights management statement, or an identifier that links
&nbsp; to a service providing information about rights management for the
&nbsp; resource.&lt;/RDFS:Comment>
